A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative Visualization: T elling Stories with Data Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer Abstract —Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these “data stories” differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and mes- saging, in terms of the balance between the narrative ﬂow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media. Index Terms —Narrative visualization, storytelling, design methods, case study, journalism, social data analysis. 1I NTRODUCTION In recent years, many have commented on the storytelling potential of data visualization. News organizations including the New Y ork Times, Washington Post, and the Guardian regularly incorporate dy- namic graphics into their journalism. Politicians, activists, and televi- sion reporters use interactive visualizations as a backdrop for storiesabout global health and economics [10] and election results [9]. A re- cent feature in The Economist [6] explores the proliferation of digital data and notes that visualization designers are “melding the skills of computer science, statistics, artistic design and storytelling. ” Static visualizations have long been used to support storytelling, usually in the form of diagrams and charts embedded in a larger bodyof text."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,data stories,"Crafting successful “data stories” requires a diverse set of skills. Gershon and Page [12] note that effective story-telling “require[s] skills like those familiar to movie directors, beyond a technical expert’s knowledge of computer engineering and science. ” While techniques from oration, prose, comic books, video games, and ﬁlm production are applicable to narrative visualization, we should also expect thisemerging medium to possess unique attributes. Data stories differ in important ways from traditional storytelling. Stories in text and ﬁlm typically present a set of events in a tightly controlled progression. While tours through visualized data similarly can be organized in a linear sequence, they can also be interactive, inviting veriﬁcation, new questions, and alternative explanations. Currently, most sophisticated visualization tools focus on data ex- ploration and analysis."

We take an empirical approach, analyzing visualizations from online journal-ism, blogs, instructional videos, and visualization research. After re- viewing related work, we share ﬁve selected case studies which high- light varied design strategies and illustrate our analytic approach. Wethen formulate a design space constructed from an analysis of 58 ex- amples."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"We describe seven genres of narrative visualization: magazine style, annotated chart, par- titioned poster, ﬂow chart, comic strip, slide show, and video. Thesegenres can be combined with interactivity and messaging to produce varying balances of author-driven and reader-driven experiences. Fi- nally, we discuss the implications of our framework, noting recurring design strategies, promising yet under-utilized approaches to integrat- ing visualization with other media, and the potential for improved userinterfaces for crafting data stories. By focusing on the graphical and interactive elements of narrative visualization, our approach gives less attention to the cognitive and emotional experience of the reader. Werecognize the importance of these elements, however, and describe di- rections for future reader-centric research in our conclusion. 2R ELATED WORK Storytelling and visual expression are integral parts of human culture; storytelling has even been referred to as “the world’s second-oldest profession” [12]. Without summarizing millennia of achievement, we describe a few of the key concepts informing narrative visualization. 2.1 Narrative Structure The Oxford English Dictionary deﬁnes narrative as “an account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them.” Central to this deﬁnition is the notion of a chain of causally related events. Stories of this form often have a beginning, middle, and end [3, 24]: an introduction to the situation, aseries of events often involving tension or conﬂict, and a resolution. Since ancient times, people have tried to understand and formalize the elements of storytelling. For example, writers (e.g., [5, 19, 21])have developed typologies of dramatic situations and identiﬁed plot lines common to many narratives, such as the “hero’s journey” [5]."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Not surprisingly, we will see that many of these techniques are also applicable to narrative visualization. 2.3 Storytelling with Data Visualization Though data visualization often evokes comparisons to storytelling [6, 7], the relationship between the two is rarely articulated clearly. Jonathan Harris, the creator of We Feel Fine and Whale Hunt , consid- ers himself a storyteller ﬁrst and a visualization designer second: “I think people have begun to forget how powerful human stories are, ex-changing their sense of empathy for a fetishistic fascination with data, networks, patterns, and total information... Really, the data is just part of the story. The human stuff is the main stuff, and the data shouldenrich it. ” Yet when pressed to describe what he means by “story,” he responds with only a rough approximation: “I deﬁne ‘story’ quite loosely."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Still, a deeper understanding of narrative visualization remains elusive, as “we need to further un- derstand the characteristic interactions of each genre with each par-ticular audience, its advantages and disadvantages, and how it might affect content and learning. ” Wojtkowski and Wojtkowski [27] further argue that what makes data visualization different from other types ofvisual storytelling is the complexity of the content that needs to be communicated. They conclude that “visual storytelling, in turn, might be of critical importance in providing intuitive and fast explorationof very large data resources, ” but again stop short of detailing how we might best “tailor visualization systems to accommodate storytelling. ” Some visualization systems have begun to incorporate storytelling into their design. For example, GeoTime Stories [8] enables analyststo create annotated stories within visualizations using a text editor andbookmarking interface. The sense.us [15] system allowed users to cre-ate trails of visualization bookmarks that were regularly used for sto-rytelling."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Here we seek to further our understanding of narrative visualization by analyzing and contrasting examples of visualizations with a story-telling component. We then generalize from these examples to identify salient design di-mensions. In the process, we hope to clarify how narrative visualiza-tion differs from other storytelling forms, and how these differences introduce both opportunities and pitfalls for its narrative potential. 3C ASE STUDIES OF NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION We collected visualizations with narrative components, and then at- tempted to identify and categorize the design features that effectivelytell stories with data. We gathered examples from sources such as on- line journalism, blogs, visualization books, research papers, and soft- ware packages. Our primary source was online journalism, includingvisualizations produced by the New Y ork Times, the Guardian, the Financial Times, the Washington Post, and Slate. Additional visual-izations were found through visualization blogs such as Flowing Data, Infosthetics, and Visual Complexity."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"The examples were chosen to provide a diverse sample of points in the design space of narrative visualization. These case studies also highlight the potential application of narrative visualization in ﬁeldsranging across journalism, sports, public policy, and ﬁnance. 3.1 Steroids or Not, the Pursuit is On Baseball star Barry Bonds points to the sky; his goal, 755 home runs, hovers over his head—“Steroids or Not, the Pursuit is On” [A36]. Shadowing Bonds’ attempt were allegations of steroid use, and manysports statisticians turned to the numbers to investigate these claims.1140 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS, VOL. 16, NO. 6, NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2010 Fig. 1.

People began to question the effectiveness of these groups amidst escalating violence in the region."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"These observations allowed us to fur- ther organize the design features into increasingly coherent categories, such as genre types for narrative visualizations and different methods of integrating visualizations with accompanying text. Our ﬁnal cate- gories depict unique patterns for narrative visualization, distinguishingitself from other forms visual storytelling. For example, interactive vi- sualizations allow users to manipulate the display, introducing design decisions that do not apply to non-interactive media. We represent the design space in a table that relates each example to speciﬁc design strategies observed across the dataset. In total we analyzed 58 visualizations using the case study method illustrated in Section 3."

Columns indicate recurring design elements and selected regions highlight patterns in th e data. Region (1) shows clusters of ordering strategies that correspond to distinct genres of visual narration. Region (2) highlights the consistency of interactive designs used by visualizat ions.
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Genres of Narrative Visualization. The ﬁrst pattern can be observed by the clusters of dark blue in the ordering section, suggesting clear differences between how visu-alizations guide the viewer through their content (Figure 7(1)). These clusters correspond to narrative formats such as slide shows, comic strips, annotated graphs, and others. We use these ordering types to identify distinct genres of visual narratives in Section 4.3."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"This may explain why qualitatively these visualizations feel more like “stories” and less like data tools. 4.3 Genres of Narrative Visualization We found that our examples can be characterized by the 7 basic genres shown in Figure 8: magazine style, annotated chart, partitioned poster, ﬂow chart, comic strip, slide show, and ﬁlm/video/animation. These genres vary primarily in terms of (a) the number of frames—distinctvisual scenes, multiplexed in time and/or space—that each contains, and (b) the ordering of their visual elements. For example, an image embedded in a page of text (“magazine style”) has only a single frame, while a comic may have many frames. A multi-view visualization (“partitioned poster”) may suggest only a loose order to its images,while a comic strip tends to follow a strict linear path."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Choosing the appropriate genre depends on a variety of factors, including the1145 SEGAL AND HEER: NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION: TELLING STORIES WITH DATA T able 1. Properties of Author-Driven and Reader-Driven Stories. Most visualizations lie along a spectrum between these two extremes. Author-Driven Reader-Driven Linear ordering of scenes No prescribed ordering Heavy messaging No messagingNo interactivity Free interactivity complexity of the data, the complexity of the story, the intended au- dience, and the intended medium."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"There are many possible types and degrees of interac- tivity, though common forms in narrative visualization include navi- gation buttons, hover highlighting, hover details-on-demand, ﬁltering,searching, drill-down, zooming, and time sliders. Importantly, the ap- propriate use of messaging and interactivity will depend on a variety of factors. Messaging might clarify visual elements but produce clut-ter. Interactivity might engage the user but detract from the author’s intended message."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"We thus place narrative visualizations along a spectrum of author-driven and reader-driven approaches (Table 1). A purely author-driven approach has a strict linear path through the visualization, relies heavily on messaging, and includes no interactiv-ity. Examples include ﬁlm and non-interactive slideshows. A strongly author-driven approach works best when the goal is storytelling or efﬁcient communication."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"However, as we have seen throughout ourcase studies, most examples of narrative visualization fall somewhere in-between, and an important attribute of narrative visualization is its ﬂexibility in balancing both elements. Visualizations are increasinglystriking a balance between the two approaches, providing room for limited interactivity within the context of a more structured narrative. This is a relatively recent development, with most mainstream exam- ples coming from online journalism. All the interactive examples in our dataset use a mix of the author- driven and reader-driven approaches."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"In particular, we note a central concern in the de- sign of narrative visualizations: the balance between author-driven1146 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS, VOL. 16, NO. 6, NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2010 elements—providing narrative structure and messaging—and reader- driven elements—enabling interactive exploration and social sharing. These results help identify successful design practices. By explicitlynaming effective techniques (e.g., “tacit tutorials”, “semantic consis- tency”, “matching on content”) we hope to facilitate their reuse. Narrative visualizations differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. In journalism, one presents related material andsources together in a “block progression” to have clear and logical transitions, and digresses “often, but not for long” [2]. Interactive sto- ries present difﬁculties for these recommendations, as giving narrativecontrol to the reader permits lengthy unordered digressions. The de- sign structures we identify help counter these pitfalls."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,data stories,"Generalizing across our examples, data stories appear to be most effective whenthey have constrained interaction at various checkpoints within a nar- rative, allowing the user to explore the data without veering too far from the intended narrative. That said, further exploration of transi-tions between author- and reader-driven elements presents an exciting area for researchers and practitioners. Our analysis also helps identify under-explored regions of the de- sign space. For example, the “magazine style” genre is the most com-mon genre for static visualizations, but has not been as richly utilized with interactive visualizations."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"As our understanding of narrative visualization improves, it also opens up new opportunities for visualization tool research. How should we extend visual analysis applications to enable storytelling?Interfaces that combine visualization construction with the speciﬁca- tion of narrative structure, textual/graphical annotation, visual high- lighting techniques, transitions, and interactive controls could have a transformative impact on the medium, so long as they can be used by data domain experts, not just technology experts. We believe that ourresults identify important features for these future tools. By identify- ing recurring design patterns, we hope to help catalyze novel tools and explorations of narrative visualization. However, we must acknowledge that we are not experts in the study of narrative. Rather, we are visualization designers and technologists seeking to better understand the potential of the medium. Inevitably, there is much that remains to be understood."
A1,Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Will these elements become less necessary as viewers become more accustomed to narrative visualization? The topic is ripe for future work, and wouldfurther beneﬁt from the input of artists, educators, and journalists. By investigating the narrative devices used in a corpus of visualiza- tions, our analysis has focused primarily on the design decisions made by visualization creators. A promising direction for future research isto focus squarely on readers’ experiences when viewing and interact- ing with narrative visualizations. Eye-tracking studies of newspaper reading [11, 16] have found that readers regularly skim by scanninggraphics, headlines, and initial paragraphs before intermittently stop- ping to read an article. Based on these results, Garcia & Stark [11] de- ﬁne newspaper design as the challenge “to give readers material that is worthy of their scan, that makes them stop scanning and start read- ing. ” How do such behaviors apply to visualization? Further research is needed to characterize how readers perceive narratives presented viavisualizations."

A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Index Terms —Rhetoric, narrative visualization, framing ef fects, semiotics, denotation, connotation.  1 INTRODUCTION   Narrative information visualizations are a style of visualization that  often explores the interplay between aspects of both explorative and communicative visualization [38]. They typically rely on a  combination of persuasive, rhetorical techniques to convey an  intended story to users as well as exploratory, dialectic strategies aimed at providing the user with control over the insights she gains  from interaction. Segel and Heer take an initial step towards  highlighting how varying degrees of authorial intention and user interaction are achieved by general design components in narrative  visualization [38]. This blend of explorative and communicative  features presents another research opportunity though: to better understand a user’s interpretation process of a narrative visualization  in light of the rhetorical conventions that the author employs. By  explicating  rhetorical techniques and how such techniques may  affect user interpretation , researchers and designers alike stand to  gain a tool for understanding how visualizations communicate. In this work we examine the design and end-user interpretation of  narrative visualizations in order to deepen understanding of how  common design techniques represent rhetorical strategies that make  certain interpretations more probable. How are rhetorical techniques used in visualization and what are the effects of these techniques on  user interpretations of data? Studies in semiotics, journalism, and  critical theory indicate particular rhetorical techniques used to communicate an intended message [1, 2, 23]. while evidence from  decision theory, survey design, and political theory [21, 36, 37]  suggests that subtle variations in a representation’s rhetorical or persuasive techniques can generate large effects on users’  interpretations of a message. Investigations related to InfoVis  provide initial evidence that how data is framed or presented can significantly affect interpretation [3]."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Given the motivation to better understand the interpretation  process of visualization, this paper investigates rhetorical strategies and effects in narrative visualization by addressing the following  research questions: • What particular conventions are used, and to what extent are  specific techniques associated with different editorial layers in the visualization (such as the data, visual representation,  annotation, and interactivity)?  • In what ways can factors external to the visualization itself,  such as internalized knowledge and conventions at the  individual and community level, interact with the rhetorical  strategies used in a narrative visualization to influence interpretation?    • How do communicative and explorative rhetorical strategies  effectively work together in a narrative visualization? This work contributes to InfoVis design and theory by providing  insight into (1) the types and forms of use of particular rhetorical  techniques in narrative visualizations, and (2) the interaction between those techniques and individual and community characteristics of  end-users. The first contribution is a taxonomy of how particular  design elements can be used strategically to directly or indirectly prioritize certain interpretations. This equips designers with a set of  techniques for designing engaging narrative visualizations capable of  communicating layered meanings. At the same time, the identification of classes of rhetorical techniques provides both  designers and InfoVis researchers with a vocabulary for analyzing  the underlying rhetorical functions of particular design strategies, a dimension that remains under-discussed in many theoretical  frameworks organized primarily around exploratory visualization. The second contribution of this work is in identifying and  demonstrating how these conventions interact with characteristics of  the visualization interaction, end-user’s knowledge, and the socio- cultural context. This stands to improve designers’ awareness of how designs might be received differently by individual end-users and  how they can cue shared cultural knowledge and associations."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"This motivates  incorporating extra-representational factors like individual and group conventions into a visualization rhetoric framework.   2.5 Narrative Visualization   In response to the growing number of online visualizations designed  to convey a story, Segel and Heer’s  [38] design space analysis  presents three ways of distinguishing categories of narrative  visualizations: (1) genres; (2) visual narrative tactics that direct attention, guide view transitions, and orient the user; and (3)  narrative structure tactics such as ordering, interactivity, and  messaging. Their contribution of abstract structures and genres provides a general framework that opens the discussion of narrative  visualization to a wider range of examples. The framework also  allows comparisons between visualizations based on how they structure users’ interactions with data. We aim to expand the  discussion of narrative visualizations to include the role of extra- representational influencers like individual, group, and contextual differences in interpretation. We outline additional visual and non- visual tactics used in narrative visualization, emphasizing how these  represent omissions, additions, and implications. Ziemkiewicz and Kosara [55] contrast information visualization  with visual representations. Narrative visualizations tend to be  excluded from their model by criteria like non-trivial interactivity (allowing users to change the visual mapping parameters themselves)  or non one-to-one mappings between the source domain and the  visual output domain. In contrast, our work explores the dynamics of constrained interactivity and techniques like visual redundancy that  are used to emphasize an intended meaning in narrative  visualization. We also extend their discussion of information loss by considering the rhetorical effects of information omissions regardless  of intention, based on our belief that the increased presence of such  visualizations makes it important for InfoVis researchers and practitioners to better understand how the editorial process of  visualizing data necessarily constrains possible interpretations.   3 V ISUALIZATION RHETORIC FRAMEWORK   A primary contribution of this paper is the development and  demonstration of an analytical framework to guide discussion of the  rhetorical aspects of InfoVis. In this section we present conceptual devices as well as the results of a large qualitative analysis used to  identify specific rhetorical strategies used in InfoVis."

We  distinguish between four editorial layers that can be used to convey  meaning, including the data, visual representation, textual  annotations, and interactivity. A given rhetorical technique might be  applied to some layers more easily than others. Yet omissions, emphases,  and ambiguity  can be accomplished at each level."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"As the  output of a designer’s decision processes, a narrative visualization  represents a sequence of choices to either add information (such as  by adding suggestions of an intended message using textual  annotations) or omit information (such as by omitting some variables or interactivity features). Distinguishing the possible sites of these choices paves the way for more recognition of their existence, and  effects on end-user interpretations. At the lowest level of the data , the creator of a visualization  makes choices about the data source to represent, including what  variables to include and which to leave out. Additional choices can further affect data, such as removing outliers, scaling, or aggregating  values."

In the interest of diversity we also  included online visualizations from news magazines (e.g. The  Economist); local news providers (e.g. annarbor.com.); political outlets (e.g. Obama.org, website of the speaker of the house); and  independent graphic designers known to publish their work in  leading news outlets (e.g."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"One remaining cluster of techniques 2233 HULLMAN AND DIAKOPOULOS: VISUALIZATION RHETORIC: FRAMING EFFECTS IN NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION   was not clearly distinguishable based on a common mechanism, but  was rather comprised of methods that instead appeared to cluster based on an origin in linguistic rhetoric (3.2.5). We then tabulated  patterns of frequency and co-occurrence of techniques in order to  show the interrelatedness of the categories (Section 3.2.7). Alternative schemes of rhetorical techniques may be possible for  narrative visualizations. However, the representativeness of our  sample leads us to believe that the categories below can serve as a guide for designers seeking to strengthen or subdue rhetorical  effects.    3.2.2  Information Access Rhetoric  The first decisions made by a visualization designer often concern  what data to represent. To simplify complex ideas in a visual representation it is often helpful to keep distracting or irrelevant  information to a minimum (e.g. [28]). Omission  techniques are the  least likely to be explicitly indicated by a visualization, yet can be inferred from data that are  available given ample contextual  information."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"The increasing prevalence of narrative visualization suggests that user- driven information loss or avoidance may be a fruitful area for  research. Metonymy techniques that manipulate part-whole relationships  serve simplification as well. At the basest level, the selection of variables to visualize involves creating a subset of a larger data set to  present a simplified visual representation of chosen features. Averaging techniques like mean, median, and clustering similarly  substitute simpler representations for a wider range of values, as do  textual and visual summaries."

These tend to be used  in titles to sarcastically set the stage for a user to arrive at an obvious  interpretation, as in ‘Budget Forecasts, Compared With Reality’ [16] where a prominent textual annotation above the visualization poses  the question “How accurate have past White House budget forecasts  been?” despite numerous other annotations explicitly describing  inaccuracies in forecasts. Quotation marks  and deliberate  understatement accomplish similar objectives. Similarity techniques resemble contrast  techniques except that  the comparison between two entities is motivated by assumed similarities between them."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"This highlights the nature of  narrative visualizations as multimedia artifacts that can’t easily be reduced to visualization alone.   3.3 Viewing Codes  The concept of viewing codes is an adaption of theories presented in  semiotics (e.g., [2]) that capture how attributes of the receiver of an  artifact influence interpretation. Viewing codes are the cultural,  perceptual, cognitive, and psychological lenses that guide how an end-user (or community) interprets a representation. This concept  sheds light on the constraints imposed on end-user interpretations by  habits and beliefs that are not explicitly contained in the visualization  but rather implied by visualization elements. Below, we discuss how  a distinction between denotation and connotation becomes  important with regard to discussions of viewing codes."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Consequently, these differences lead to differences in how users  interpret the implications of the story in a narrative visualization. Perceptual codes  constrain what is salient to the user given  human visual perception tendencies, such as gestalt principles of  continuation, common fate, and closure [47]. Perceptual tendencies  can combine with internalized knowledge to form additional types of codes such as textual codes, the conventions associated with the  presentation and interpretation of text. With regard to online  information visualizations, these include the common positioning of the title either in the top center or top left of the presentation, the  inclusion of source and designer credits toward the lower right or left  hand corners of the layout, as well as the assumed left-to-right reading style in many Western cultures noted by [38]."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Together, these choices convey a sense that the visualization  provides a relatively unobstructed presentation of all information 2237 HULLMAN AND DIAKOPOULOS: VISUALIZATION RHETORIC: FRAMING EFFECTS IN NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION   necessary to decode the patterns inhering in the data. The depicted  story of the spatial distribution of ethnic groups is further supported  by consistent mappings, such as of groups to colors that are applied identically to data points in the multiple views. Yet like any visualization, less impartial choices are evident as  well. The choice to represent the families part of the ‘Housing and Families’ category with a single variable on ‘Same-Sex Couples’  represents an example of information access rhetoric through  metonomy , as it omits other families like two parent or single person  households."

We suggest  several important considerations for this space highlighted by our  analysis, and note areas that may be fruitful for future exploration. The effects of subtle rhetorical manipulation of information has  generated sometimes surprising results in decision theory and  political and communication studies. Applying a similar experimental approach to narrative visualizations is a natural  parallel. Our work sets the stage for such studies by providing a  taxonomy of specific information presentation manipulations used in narrative visualizations. Formal models that have been developed to  capture the formation of user opinions as dependent on personal  attitudes [35] similarly motivate future modelling of combined effects of rhetorical techniques and personal and cultural viewing  codes on a user’s interpretation in narrative visualization. Acknowledging the distinction between denotation and  connotation contributes to InfoVis design and theory by highlighting  an epistemological tension that invades many narrative  visualizations. This tension lies between techniques of ""objective"" charts informed by transparency ideals on the one hand, and the  layers of connoted interpretation that can seep into or co-opt the  basis of objectivity via rhetorical strategies on the other. The ‘Poll Dancing’ example leverages the visual representation to precisely  depict trends in forecasting."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Future work includes devising means of assessing  narrative visualizations such that these positive influences are  recognized, while still acknowledging the potential for rhetorical decisions to negatively affect a user’s accurate interpretation of data. A frequent example of such a productive tension in our sample is  the tension observable in some narrative visualizations that appear to be concerned with presenting their work as credible even in cases where the journalist may have taken some liberties in preparing the  graphic. This is likely the influence of journalistic notions of  transparency, where creators are expected to be upfront about their  knowledge as well as what they don’t know [23]. In many examples, the journalist’s presence is explicitly stated, such as through notes  about how a visualization contains ‘predictions’ or ‘forecasts’ at the  bottom of the graph (see Fig. 4). These acknowledgements may play a double role in the sense that they strengthen the sense of the  journalist’s or designer’s integrity despite explicitly pointing to a  lack thereof."
A2,Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"This observation dovetails with the observation that codes or conventions appear to operate in narrative visualizations. Not only do transparency clues suggest that an end-user should  believe the specific interpretation being emphasized in the visualization, they also implicitly suggest to users a preferred way of  making similar decisions when viewing other visualizations. Insight  from critical media and semiotic studies suggests that such codes are dynamic systems that change over time [10]. Many professionally  produced narrative visualizations form part of a larger system of  meaning and rhetoric, knowledge of which guides an informed user on how to interpret the particular example. By giving more attention  to the development, maintenance, and propagation of such  conventions in information visualization, researchers and designers alike stand to gain control over dimensions of interpretation that  have remained mostly unaccounted for or underexplored. A related discussion prompted by this work concerns the degree  of intentionality that can be assumed behind the rhetorical effects  achieved in narrative visualization. In analysis we noted all possible,  although not necessarily intended, framing effects of design choices. Future studies could involve interviewing visualization creators to  assess their cognizance and intentionality of these methods. In any  case, the power of rhetorical techniques to manipulate user interpretations supports a call for increased responsibility among  designers to consider the possibly unintended effects their choices  may have."

A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"A Deeper Understanding of Sequence  in Narrative Visualization Jessica Hullman, Steven Drucker, Nathalie Henry Riche, Bongshin Lee, Danyel Fisher, and Eytan Adar Abstract—Conveying a narrative with visualizations often requires choosing an order in which to present visualizations. While evidence exists that narrative sequencing in traditional stories can affect comprehension and memory, little is known about how sequencing choices affect narrative visualization. We consider the forms and reactions to sequencing in narrative visualization presentations to provide a deeper understanding with a focus on linear, “slideshow-style” presentations. We conduct a qualitative analysis of 42 professional narrative visualizations to gain empirical knowledge on the forms that structure and sequence take. Based on the results of this study we propose a graph-driven approach for automatically identifying effective sequences in a set of visualizations to be presented linearly. Our approach identifies possible transitions in a visualization set and prioritizes local (visualization-to-visualization) transitions based on an objective function that minimizes the cost of transitions from the audience perspective. We conduct two studies to validate this function."

Index Terms—Data storytelling, narrative visualization, narrative structure.  1 INTRODUCTION Storytelling is now a focus in visualization research and practice, as the study of narrative visualizations (e.g., [13][26]), development of automated data storytelling tools (e.g., [21]), and proliferation of narrative visualizations in news media attest. Supporting data story creation among those who may lack training in visualization design is particularly valuable, as these users may have domain expertise that allows them to produce useful insights into public data. Story creation involves sequential processes of context definition, information selection, modality selection, and choosing an order to effectively convey the intended narrative. In using visualizations to tell a story, the events of interest are patterns in data sets represented in visualizations. A typical creation process involves using a tool like Tableau [31] or Microsoft Excel [19] to visually analyze data, and to generate visualizations via vector graphics or images for presenta-tion."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Research in narrative visualization points to visualization features that afford storytelling including guided emphasis (e.g., spatial or-dering or partial animation [13][27] and structures for reader-driven storytelling (e.g., the Drill-down story [27]). Yet much is still to be learned about the principles that govern effective structuring of tran-sitions between consecutive visualizations in narrative presentations, and how different tactics for sequencing visualizations are combined into global strategies in formats like slideshow presentations. A gap also exists in current understanding around how end-users’ percep-tions are affected by sequencing choices in narrative visualization. What characteristics make a sequence of visualizations successful in the eyes of users, as well as the designer? With the popularity of narrative visualization among individuals who may lack design or statistical expertise yet have important domain knowledge to con-tribute, a deeper understanding of sequence could pave the way for tools and systems that support more effective story structuring. We focus in particular on how linear, slideshow-style presentations can benefit from knowledge on the effects of sequencing styles on user perceptions and message communication. These may include slideshows based on series of data representations for live presenta-tion as well as interactive visualization slideshows presented online. A central contribution of our work is an outline of how automatic sequencing could be approached in designing systems to help non-designers navigate structuring decisions in creating narrative visuali-zations, such as by semi-automatically identifying and presenting more “effective” visualization sequences during a design session."

We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for the design of linear-style narrative visualization presentations and tools to support non-designers in creating narrative visualizations. 2 RELATED WORK 2.1 Narrative Sequencing and Styling Our work is motivated by the systematic analysis of narrative in cognitive psychology. Researchers have empirically demonstrated that stories are perceived as being made of conceptually-separable episodes or sub-goals in a chain of actions that form the story’s plot [2]. Stories are thought to contain microstructure via the particular details of an event and macro-structure via the relationship of those events to one another in the plot (e.g., [32]). We make an analogy between story episodes and visualization states in narrative visualiza-tions, which must also be sequenced to form a larger presentation."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Yet just as jurors in a trial must learn and choose among decision alterna-tives in order to generate the most likely story, creators of narrative visualizations must infer viable transitions between visualizations and make judgments about which are most persuasive to use in a story. By inquiring into transition principles and how end-users react to them, we intend to support this aspect of the story creation.  2.2 Narrative Visualization  Existing research around narrative visualization creation includes systems for visualizing and sharing public and personally relevant data (e.g., [33]); supporting new interaction styles from rich media artifacts (e.g., [20]); and design space taxonomies to describe tech-niques used in exemplar professional artifacts [13][27]. The latter studies provide generalized advice for designing narrative visualiza-tions. In addition to noting narrative formats that appear in interac-tive narrative visualizations such as the interactive slideshow [27], these studies describe how prioritization and sequencing of infor-mation can occur through spatial ordering, animation, and suggestive default views, among others [13] [27]. Yet, despite giving examples of successful structuring techniques, there is a lack of clearly out-lined measures that creators can use to find the best sequence for visualizations among multiple possible sequences. We extend work in narrative visualization via an understanding of sequence informed by empirical analysis of professional visualizations as well as user validated measures and transition characterizations. Prior work on visualization transitions includes Heer and Robert-son’s [10] study of animated transitions in statistical graphics. Though they focused primarily on the effect of animation and stag-ing of transitions taken as given, we note parallels between our prin-ciple of maintaining consistency and the guidelines they propose. The taxonomy of transition types we identify in professional narra-tive visualizations offer an end-user perspective of conceptually-based transitions (i.e., changes to the data being shown), providing a counterpoint to the types that Heer and Robertson define from a sys-tem representation of schematic and syntactic operations applied to data."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"We expand on their observations of transitions based in timesteps, filtering, and data schema changes, elaborating how users perceive these and other conceptual changes that occur in transitions. 2.3 The Role of Alternatives in Design Our intention to inform the design of tools for supporting narrative visualization creation is motivated by design research demonstrating the importance of exploration of alternative designs among creators. Researchers like Duncker [8] have shown that individuals often fix-ate on a single or narrow range of potential solutions early in a de-sign process. Studies of successful design processes, however, indi-cate that generating and considering alternatives supports better un-derstanding of the design specification: constraints and guidelines that are not in the initial specification but which help dictate what makes for a desirable design [16]. These insights have been applied most recently in ad design studies that find that parallel prototyping techniques that involve early generation of diverse examples produce better quality designs than techniques based in iteration and refining of a single design [7]."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"We note that the time constraints operating on creators of narrative visualization presentations like data slideshows make it unlikely that all possible sequencings for telling a given story from a visualization set will be explored. The risk is that the creator uses a less compelling sequence than they might. Having a better understanding what drives sequencing choices in narrative visualization, and a user-validated approach for algorithmically iden-tify and prioritizing possible sequences is one way to work towards supporting exploration in the narrative visualization design process.  3 PATTERNS IN NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION SEQUENCE 3.1 Motivating Scenario  Many narrative visualizations that researchers point to are created by professional designers who draw on advanced training in journalism, graphic design, statistics, and other relevant fields to create compel-ling presentations (e.g., [13][27]). Yet in numerous scenarios, non-designers create presentations from visualized data for the purpose of communicating a narrative of interest to a stakeholder or group. A marketing analyst or other data consultant may present clients with data presentations that describe the state of the market for a product, or the results of a change made to the client business strategy, prod-uct, or website. In many such cases, these individuals must first make sense of data themselves to distil important points for a presen-tation, capture these points in data representations like visualizations, and then sequence these representations in a linear presentation."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"We next describe an analysis of professional narrative visualizations that we used in order to identify what makes a good sequence. Our observations inform an algorith-mic approach to identifying sequences introduced in Sect. 4. 2407 HULLMAN ET AL: A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF SEQUENCE IN NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION 3.2 Qualitative Analysis  To inform the design of a tool that suggests good story structures with insights on the strategies of professional designers, we conduct-ed a qualitative analysis of the structural aspects of 42 examples of explicitly-guided (i.e., unambiguously linearly ordered) professional narrative visualizations. The study poses several questions about sequencing in professional narrative visualization presentations:  • What types of changes (transition types) drive between-visualization transitions in linear narrative visualizations? • Are there general characteristics that are shared among the common types of transitions?  • How do strategies for local (visualization-to-visualization) transitions compare to global transitions (patterns involving multiple local transitions)?    3.2.1 Study Design 42 narrative visualizations created between 2006 and 2012 were compiled (full list in supplementary file). We seeded the set with visualizations in an independently-curated sample of New York Times (NYT) and Guardian interactives [23]. Additional examples came from visualization blogs and repositories (e.g., visualizing.org) and well-known news sources (e.g., BBC). We included only visual-izations with non-ambiguous sequencing cues like numbered slides or steps across linked views, a “Next,” “→,” or “Continue” button, or a “Play” button for a self-running video or slideshow."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"While the individual states that comprise a visualization sequence are fairly unambiguous in a slideshow-style presentation, the constit-uent states of smooth animated narrative visualizations are more difficult to identify. A visualization state has been defined as a set of parameters applied to data [14], or the settings of interface widgets in a visualization environment along with the application content [11]. We define a narrative visualization state as an informationally-distinct visual representation and transitions as state changes after [10]. Our definition of a state does not consider different portions of a single static visualization to be unique states. Though static visuali-zations are likely to be processed sequentially (such as if labels sug-gest that users examine data in a particular order), coding these would require more arbitrary judgments on how to divide static graphs. While a slideshow composed of unique static slides often divides into one state per slide, a single slide can represent multiple states if it contains animation within single numbered slides."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,data story,"Coding proceeded as follows: two coders first informally ana-lyzed visualizations in the set with a focus on those aspects of the presentations that suggested how consecutive states in a data story are prioritized or ordered. Over several iterations, various categories of state-to-state order emerged. A coding protocol that captured these aspects was created and discussed by both coders. Visual interaction strategies that appeared relevant to sequencing, such as animated transitions between states, were also noted."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"This entailed reviewing the combinations of transitions that occurred in each presentation to note patterns indicat-ing global sequencing strategies.   3.2.2 Design Implications Several insights that emerged from our analysis inform the design of an algorithmic approach that we describe below for identifying se-quencing possibilities in narrative visualization. The first implication consists of a set of transition types characterizing the difference be-tween the data shown in one visualization and another that directly follows it (see Table 1). A key aspect of the types we observed is that each represents a single change in one dimension of a data represen-tation from one slide (visualization) to the next. As such, the types imply a data-dependent intention behind sequencing choices."
A3,A Deeper Understanding of Sequence in Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Considering psychological theories of narrative understanding, maintaining a certain amount of consistency between states is likely to make it easier for users to generate the explanations that tie the patterns rep-resented by visualizations into a coherent story.  4 AN ALGORITHMIC APPROACH TO VISUALIZATION SE-QUENCE SUPPORT  We propose a graph-driven approach to finding effective sequences for narrative visualizations informed by our analysis. The approach specifies a format for representing different visualization states as nodes in a graph so as to allow an algorithm to compare nodes and label potential transitions using the types outlined in Sect. 3. Inputs and stages are shown in Fig. 2.

But do audiences of narra-tive visualizations regard two visualization states representing a measure walk transition as equally different to two visualizations representing a temporal transition? The visual information analysis mantra [29] “overview, zoom & filter, detail on demand” suggests that general-to-specific transitions are preferable, but this has not been empirically evaluated, and other questions remain.

As  an emerging medium, narrative  visualization can borrow techniques from existing storytelling  sources (e.g., comics, posters, etc.) [39], and extend them to develop a more engaging form of storytelling. In a form of narrative visualization called whiteboard animation  (also known as video scribing) [36], the presenter produces a sequence of dynamic sketches along with synchronized narration to  vividly tell a story. There is anecdotal evidence that this may be  more effective for delivering information than traditional presentations.

A5,Attractive Flicker — Guiding Attention in Dynamic Narrative Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"See http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.———— Attractive Flicker ———— Guiding Attention in Dynamic Narrative Visualizations Manuela Waldner, Mathieu Le Muzic, Matthias Bernhard, Werner Purgathofer, Member, IEEE , and Ivan Viola Abstract — Focus+context techniques provide visual guidance in visualizations by giving strong visual prominence to elements of interest while the context is suppressed. However, ﬁnding a visual feature to enhance for the focus to pop out from its context in a large dynamic scene, while leading to minimal visual deformation and subjective disturbance, is challenging. This paper proposes Attractive Flicker, a novel technique for visual guidance in dynamic narrative visualizations. We ﬁrst show that ﬂicker is a strong visual attractor in the entire visual ﬁeld, without distorting, suppressing, or adding any scene elements. The novel aspect of our Attractive Flicker technique is that it consists of two signal stages: The ﬁrst “orientation stage” is a short but intensive ﬂicker stimulus to attract the attention to elements of interest. Subsequently, the intensive ﬂicker is reduced to a minimally disturbing luminance oscillation (“engagement stage”) as visual support to keep track of the focus elements."

Examples are 3D visualizations of physiological processes, crowd simulations, multiple coordinated views of dynamically chang-ing stock exchange data, or observation and collaboration interfaces in emergency response centers. What these examples have in com- mon is that a lot of dynamically changing data has to be displayedconcurrently. This is often achieved by using large displays, such as projection screens or multi-monitor setups."

Therefore, we ﬁrst summarize basics from the visual perception and cognition point of view, followed by related work on attention guidance. 2.1 Visual Attention When observing an image, there are several factors that inﬂuence where our attention is directed. Feature integration theory (FIT) [41] suggests that multiple feature dimensions of an image – such as color,orientation, spatial frequency, brightness, and movement direction – are rapidly processed automatically and in parallel. This preattentive processing ability enables observers to catch certain properties of ascene in less than 250 milliseconds, i.e., without moving the eyes to scan the scene."

Experiments with implementations of bottom-up saliency mod-els (e.g., [20, 19]) showed that motion and ﬂicker feature maps were stronger predictors of users’ saccade directions than color, intensity,and orientation contrasts [18, 31], indicating that dynamic features arestronger visual attractors than static ones. It is well known that bottom-up saliency is by far not the only factor inﬂuencing attention in visual scenes. Guided search theory by Wolfe et al. [47] assumes that visual attention is guided by both, bottom- up and top-down information."

A5,Attractive Flicker — Guiding Attention in Dynamic Narrative Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"But given that users rated ﬂicker as disturbing in prior work [16], can we ﬁnd a way to make it more appealing for narrative visualizations, where observerswill be exposed to visual guidance for a longer time? 5A TTRACTIVE FLICKER The goal of Attractive Flicker is to exploit the effectiveness of lumi- nance ﬂicker for visual guidance, as demonstrated in the preceding pilot experiment, while decreasing the disturbance of the signal for a long-term exposure. The basic idea is to split the signal into two dis-tinct stages, corresponding to the two visual attention stages by human observers described by Healey and Enns [15]: In the initial orientation stage , a short but sufﬁciently strong signal effectively guides the user’s attention to the focus element. In the subsequent engagement phase , the signal strength is smoothly reduced and remains at a constantly low level to minimize disturbance. What needs to be investigated ishow long the initial orientation stage needs to be, as well as the ﬂicker parameters for the two stages."

Forth, the relative annoyance ratings of the second perceptual study only relate to the signal itself, not to the signal in context of a real task. In real scenarios, the annoyance caused by an attractor also depends onits perceived usefulness. Therefore, researchers have recommended to adjust the attractor strength to its interruption importance [11]."

However, this proposed two-stage design is not lim- ited to luminance ﬂicker. The same principle can be applied for all different sort of visual attractors that increase the visual emphasis ofthe focus object. For instance, when applying the two-stage concept to halos around focus elements, a large and clearly visible bright high- light around the focus object will dynamically shrink to a small, subtlehalo in the engagement stage."
A5,Attractive Flicker — Guiding Attention in Dynamic Narrative Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"This way, the transition phase would be initiated only after the user directs the gaze towards the highlighted target. 10.2 Narrative Visualizations and Other Use Cases The ﬁeld of narrative visualization has generated increased interest in recent years [46, 37, 27]. According to Segel and Heer [37], highlight- ingto guide the user’s attention to elements of interest is one of three visual narrative tactics , besides providing the user with an overview (visual structuring ) and transition guidance to change the visualiza- tion viewpoint or representation without disorienting the user. Thesetactics can co-exist in parallel. For instance, animated transitions can resolve occlusions, while visual highlighting guides the user’s gaze to the most relevant regions while preserving the context."
A5,Attractive Flicker — Guiding Attention in Dynamic Narrative Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative visualization is not only used to passively communicate a pre-deﬁned story, as in our use case, but it is also an important tool to guide interactive exploration of complex information. For instance,when constantly analyzing a large amount of real-time data, such as during emergency management or stock broking, Attractive Flicker can help to make new and important data visually stand out in a mini-mally obtrusive way. Similarly, Attractive Flicker could serve as indi- cator of visual changes caused by user’s brushing actions in large-scale multiple coordinated views. For this application area, it will be nec-essary to explore the effectiveness of multiple synchronous Attractive Flicker targets, potentially with different strengths matched to the pre- dicted degrees of interest of the elements."
A5,Attractive Flicker — Guiding Attention in Dynamic Narrative Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"In a showcase scenario of molecular interactions on a large display,we could verify that Attractive Flicker indeed adds minimal distrac- tion, but is still a highly effective technique to guide the user through a narrative visualization.

A wea lth of  data-driven stories can now be found online, as journalists, wo rking  for media outlets such as The New York Times [10] and The Guard ian  [7], as well as data enthusiasts [6], craft custom narrative vi sualiza- tions for broad audiences [41]. Short data-driven motion graphi cs, also  known as data videos , which combine both visual and auditory stimuli  to convey a story, have garnered renewed attention [18]. Endowe d  with desirable properties, such as having a short duration and engaging  visual effects and animations, data videos are a promising medi um for  conveying a data -driven narrative."

A7,Temporal Summary Images: An Approach to Narrative Visualization via Interactive Annotation Generation and Placement,1,1,data storytelling,"As the analysis and visual design processes converge, the resultant image becomes appropriate for data storytelling. For validation, we use a prototype implementation for TSIs to conduct two case studies with large-scale, scientiﬁc simulation datasets. Index Terms—Narrative visualization, storytelling, annotations, comic strip visualization, time-varying data. 1 I NTRODUCTION Visualization may be used as both an exploratory and explanatory tool for those who routinely need to analyze and extract essential informa- tion from their datasets and then communicate ﬁndings with others. While many visual analysis methods have been developed, there is less support for creating narrative visualizations. In particular, as data becomes large, complex, multidimensional, and sometimes heteroge- neous, manually sifting through, identifying, and highlighting the es- sential aspects of a chart or graph becomes a laborious task. It would be desirable if, over the process of exploration and analysis, the vi- sualization system suggests important areas and features to select and label, for the purpose of deriving a data story to use in subsequent tasks or presentations. To help address this problem, we present Temporal Summary Im- ages (TSIs), a framework to create narrative visualizations of multi- variate, time-varying datasets. Visually, a TSI is composed of three common components: (1) a temporal layout view such as a line chart or storyline, (2) data snapshots appended at relevant timesteps, and (3) anchored textual annotations. Figure 1 shows an example TSI. It succinctly tells a story about immigration in the United States using a stacked graph for its temporal layout, ﬁve cartographic maps as the set of data snapshots, and six descriptive annotations."
A7,Temporal Summary Images: An Approach to Narrative Visualization via Interactive Annotation Generation and Placement,1,1,data story,"As these two tasks synthesize together, a uniﬁed, summary data story effectively emerges that em- phasizes the important aspects and trends of the underlying dataset. Further stylizing the components results in an image appropriate for presentation or public display according to the author’s purpose. We have created a prototype TSI application based on the frame- work and techniques we describe in this paper. For validation, we con- duct two case studies using large-scale, scientiﬁc simulation datasets (a disease and cosmological model, respectively)."
A7,Temporal Summary Images: An Approach to Narrative Visualization via Interactive Annotation Generation and Placement,1,1,narrative visualization,"Based on domain participant feedback, our approach is effective for both analyzing and summarizing datasets. 2 B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK Related prior work falls into two main categories: (1) narrative vi- sualization and storytelling as methods for communicating data, and (2) the three speciﬁc visual components of a TSI: time-varying tech- niques, small multiples (also called comic strips), and annotations. 2.1 Narrative Visualization and Storytelling Segel and Heer categorize and review narrative visualization in [35]. They describe seven speciﬁc genres for this, including annotated graphs/charts and comic strip visualizations. A narrative visualization can be framed to tell a data story by prioritizing a speciﬁc interpreta- tion or perception of the data [19]. The concept of data storytelling itself has been highlighted in the In- foVis, SciVis, and business communities [15, 23, 25, 28]. Here, the fo- cus is on how ﬁlm, literary, and theatrical narrative conventions can be used to adapt visualizations for communication to broad demographic audiences. In [26], Lee et al. argue for explicitly deﬁning the scope of what should be called a data story, and propose a three-step process for visual storytelling based on the following tasks: (1) ﬁnd insights, (2) create a story, and (3) tell the story. We focus the TSI process on the ﬁrst two points: exploring the data and creating a presentation-quality visualization. In the broader context of visualization design for communication, Moere and Leuven argue in [32] that aesthetics make up an important third constraint for visualization (in addition to soundness andutility). Recent papers have focused on the workﬂow aspects of creating info- graphic or presentation-style visualizations [7,34,39,46], though most require fully manual design with no consideration for analytic tasks."
A7,Temporal Summary Images: An Approach to Narrative Visualization via Interactive Annotation Generation and Placement,1,1,data storytelling,"These techniques support detailed interactions and under- standing with the underlying data, but do so at the expense of having to focus on speciﬁc visual layouts (i.e., only streamgraphs) and do not consider data storytelling or presentation. In contrast, TSIs can dis- play multiple types of temporal views and use text annotations as a way to communicate qualitative data observations without requiring a training period for TSI authors/viewers to interpret their meanings. 2.3 Small Multiples and Comic Strips Small multiples use a set of views (or frames) at discrete data incre- ments to show change across one or more dimensions [41]. When this change tends to follow a strictly linear data path (even if it involves zooming and ﬁltering), the technique can be deﬁned as a comic strip- style of narrative visualization [35]. Prior work has used comic strip visualizations as a way to summa- rize or present data [12, 45, 46]. Conversely, the VizPattern system uses comic strips as an interface for creating visual queries to generate data charts [21]. A recent paper called Graph Comics [7] uses comic strips to summarize network change over time."
A7,Temporal Summary Images: An Approach to Narrative Visualization via Interactive Annotation Generation and Placement,1,1,narrative visualization,"Based on feedback and ob- servations, we feel that TSIs are effective in assisting domain users analyzing their data and creating succinct, narrative visualizations. 6.1.1 Case Study One: EpiSimS Simulation EpiSimS is a scalable, stochastic, agent-based model for infectious disease within the United States [30]. Based on input parameters like transmission rate, incubation period, mosquito population, and response mechanisms, a disease is introduced into a susceptible popu- lation where it spreads through agent-to-agent interaction. In a normal (non-TSI) workﬂow, team members select a set of input parameters and run an instance of the simulation. To examine the output data at- tributes, they usually create line charts and/or spatial views using a conventional tool like R or matplotlib."
A7,Temporal Summary Images: An Approach to Narrative Visualization via Interactive Annotation Generation and Placement,1,1,data stories,"With an end result of building visual data stories, it has advantages over a highly complex, technical, or multi-component approach designed purely for data analysis. The intentional use of conventional (and even simple) visual com- ponents in a TSI is an additional strength. By not introducing novel visual representations, an author building a TSI for presentation knows that there is no inherent learning curve for the potential audience, es- pecially since annotations are text-based, and can focus instead on an- alyzing and summarizing the data. 7.2 Automatically Scoring Data Attributes As noted in Section 5.2.1, our current system only supports manual attribute scoring. However, it is possible to automatically derive at- tribute scores based on dataset properties."
A7,Temporal Summary Images: An Approach to Narrative Visualization via Interactive Annotation Generation and Placement,1,1,narrative visualization,"By leveraging “under the hood” techniques to assist user analysis and design, we ease the process of creating narrative visualizations for complex or multidimensional datasets, helping bridge the gap between data exploration and storytelling. A TSI is an apt analytics and summarization technique for many datasets, and we provide examples of its use in both general and sci- entiﬁc domains, along with domain user feedback validating our ap- proach. Future work will focus on maturing and improving our imple- mented framework and expanding it to new features and techniques.

Biographies, historical summaries, and project plans are often distilled as timelines to tell a story, where the goal of the storyteller is to present known infor- mation in an appropriate and engaging way. From the hand- drawn illustrations of centuries past to contemporary infographics, people have employed a wide range of visual forms for telling timeline stories."
A8,Timelines Revisited: A Design Space and Considerations for Expressive Storytelling,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Ultimately, our work is intended to both ground and inspire the design of future interactive tools for producing visual timeline stories. 2 B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK This section provides background information with regards to timelines, data-driven storytelling, and the use of animated transi- tions for preserving context. 2.1 Timelines A timeline depicts a sequence of events, or interval event data using the precise terminology of Aigner et al. [5], which is to be distinguished from instant or continuous quantitative time- series data. A simple timeline indicates the types of events being depicted, the number of events, and the order in which they occurred. A more detailed timeline may indicate when the events occurred in chronological time, how long they lasted, and whether any of the events overlapped. Typically, an event is visually encoded using some graphical mark, such as a line or an icon."

Reviewing visualization in the domain of data journalism, Segel and Heer [82] introduced the term narrative visualization and identiﬁed seven distinct genres. Hullman and Diakopoulos [46] then investigated the types and forms of rhetorical techniques used in narrative visualization. Since then, Kosara and Mackinlay [53] and more recently Lee et al. [57] have provided a concise, high- level review of storytelling with visualization and discussed future research directions. Other research efforts were speciﬁcally aimed to inform the design of visualization storytelling tools. Hullman et al. [47] ex- plored the effect of sequencing in narrative visualization, focusing on linear, slideshow-style presentations. Amini et al. [7] looked into professionally created data videos and identiﬁed high-level narrative structures. Through an analysis of a curated collection of data-driven stories shared on the web, Stolper et al. [86] identiﬁed the spectrum of techniques that data-storytellers are using to inform the design of data-storytelling tools. Finally, Satyanarayan and Heer [80] introduced a model of storytelling based on state- based scene structures and used it to realize Ellipsis, an data storytelling authoring tool."

A9,Narvis: Authoring Narrative Slideshows for Introducing Data Visualization Designs,1,1,narrative visualization,"However, instead of decomposing a current design and mapping it to an alternative one, Narvis extracts the basic compositions of a visual design for introducing this design progressively and structurally. 2.3 Authoring Tools for Narrative Visualizations The extensive requirements of data communication have motivated re- searchers to investigate techniques for authoring narrative visualization. User experience represents a vital concern when utilizing an author- ing tool. SketchStory [25], with its free-form sketching of interaction, provides an engaging approach to creating and presenting narrative visualizations. DataClips [2] lowers the barrier of crafting a narrative visualization by providing a library of data clips, thereby allowing non- experts to be involved in producing narrative visualizations. Lyra [33] allows designers to author expressive visualization designs through drag-and-drop interactions without writing code. Information delivery is the core consideration of an authoring tool. Existing authoring tools typically select a speciﬁc type of narrative visualization based on the information type [2, 16]."
A9,Narvis: Authoring Narrative Slideshows for Introducing Data Visualization Designs,1,1,narrative visualization,"Meanwhile, inte- grating an authoring tool for narrative visualization with a data analysis tool is becoming a trend since it effectively bridges the gap between data analysis and communication [7, 15, 26]. These tools offer inspiring user interaction design and provide fa- vorable examples for implementing narrative visualization. However, these tools treat visual encoding as a cognitively obvious attribute that can be universally recognized without a formal introduction. Thus, these tools are ill-suited for introducing visualization designs. Contrary to the aforementioned tools, Narvis enables people to produce narrative tutorial slideshows, which introduce visualization designs by decom- posing a visualization design and explaining their visual components progressively . 3 U NDERSTANDING ENDUSERS To better guide the design and implementation of Narvis, we conducted interviews with two groups of end users ( i.e., teachers and students) to investigate their current practice of producing tutorials and understand- ing visualizations."

We ﬁrst propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations—causal graphs and Hasse diagrams—with and without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe C AUSE WORKS , a causality visualization system for understanding how speciﬁc interventions inﬂuence a causal model."
A10,Once Upon A Time In Visualization: Understanding the Use of Textual Narratives for Causality,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Index Terms—Causality visualization, natural language generation, data-driven storytelling, temporal data, quantitative studies. 1 I NTRODUCTION STORIES are a central part of what it means to be human [40, 53]. They teach, guide, and caution; they store, recall, and archive; they praise, spread joy, and inspire. In particular, stories are especially useful for encapsulating causality—the cause and effect of events in a plot—in a regular, understandable, and memorable format. This format is also surprisingly scalable."
A10,Once Upon A Time In Visualization: Understanding the Use of Textual Narratives for Causality,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"The contributions of our paper are the following: (1) a design space for complementary textual narratives in representing causality; (2) results from a crowdsourced study evaluating different causality visual- izations with and without companion narratives; (3) an implementation of textual narratives in an existing causality analytics and visualization system (C AUSE WORKS ); and (4) qualitative results from 5 experts using these narratives to understand climate change data. 2 B ACKGROUND Here we discuss the existing literature on causality, causality visualiza- tion, and data-driven storytelling. 2.1 Causality Visualization Causal networks or directed acyclic graphs are commonly used to map relationships between variables [47]. Much of the work in causal visualization aims to encode aspects of causality such as temporal developments of cause and effect [20] using interactivity [64, 65] and animations [34] to improve the accuracy of causal inference. Researchers have uncovered characteristics and shortcomings of spe- ciﬁc visual representations of causality. For example, Bae et al. [4] ﬁnd that multiple to/from connections from a particular node may inﬂuence how an analyst perceives indirect effects."
A10,Once Upon A Time In Visualization: Understanding the Use of Textual Narratives for Causality,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Combining the idea of communication-minded visualization with storytelling yields the notion of data-driven storytelling: narrative techniques for data [54]. We believe that data-driven storytelling naturally follows the idea of visualization for explanation (the latter). The production, presenta- tion, and dissemination of analysis results is an important challenge in visualization and visual analytics [60]. Gershon and Page ﬁrst pro- posed using storytelling for visualization [24], and their work has since been followed up by workshops [12, 13], surveys [31, 54], and even commercial tools [37]. Vi ´egas and Wattenberg note the inclination of visualization for communication by virtue of its graphical form, and encourage focusing on so-called communication-minded visualiza- tion[63] for social analysis."
A10,Once Upon A Time In Visualization: Understanding the Use of Textual Narratives for Causality,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"For this reason, we tend to think of these textual narratives as a form of data-driven storytelling [50]—the use of traditional nar- rative methods to convey data—that relies on a textual, rather than a visual, medium. We believe that a textual narrative can also replace the visualization, at least to provide a high-level summary [22, 44]. 3.1 Deﬁnitions The causal relation !is a relation that connects two elements (events) x andyasx!yiffxis the cause of y.

Based on the review, we isolated several interest- ing questions about the role of textual narratives for this purpose.

One possible explanation might be that people naturally link the temporal context with the GIF playing progress, thereby resulting in a large number of data-GIFs in this category.

One possible explanation might be that people naturally link the temporal context with the GIF playing progress, thereby resulting in a large number of data-GIFs in this category. Speciﬁcally, some GIFs (Fig. 2a) describe the development of data in a continuous, chronological sequence, and others (Fig. 3a) may present data in multiple speciﬁc moments or time periods. •Faceting (26.0%; 28) — Another portion of data-GIFs are designed to show the facets of a data set in a series of frames respectively (refer to the faceting pattern in data comics [11]). For example, different data items are encoded in a set of frames regarding the same attribute for comparison."

A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,narrative visualization,"Abstract —Visual data stories shown in the form of narrative visualizations such as a poster or a data video, are frequently used in data-oriented storytelling to facilitate the understanding and memorization of the story content. Although useful, technique barriers, such as data analysis, visualization, and scripting, make the generation of a visual data story difﬁcult. Existing authoring tools rely on users’ skills and experiences, which are usually inefﬁcient and still difﬁcult. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual data story generating system, Calliope, which creates visual data stories from an input spreadsheet through an automatic process and facilities the easy revision of the generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly, Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order. The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts."

Index Terms—Information Visualization, Visual Storytelling, Data Story 1 I NTRODUCTION Visual data story is a representation of a series of meaningfully con- nected story pieces (i.e., data facts) in the form of a narrative visual- ization [23, 40]. Such form of representation is frequently used in a data-driven storytelling process due to its efﬁciency in terms of support- ing the comprehension and memorization of the telling content [3, 20]. Examples include various data news created by journalists in New York Times and Prof. Hans Rosling’s talks on human development trends. Although useful, creating a visual data story requires an author to have a variety of skills, including data analysis, visualization, and scripting, which are usually difﬁcult to perform for an ordinary user.

These tools usually incorporate built-in data analysis and visualization components to help with the story creation process. However, users must be involved to manually extract the data insights, write scripts, and assemble story pieces logically. Such involvement is usually inefﬁcient and the quality of the resulting story still relies on the users’ experiences and skills."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"Therefore, instead of developing another interactive authoring tool, a more intelligent system that can automatically generate a high-quality data story directly from the input data and support ﬂexible story editing functions is desired by ordinary users who have limited data knowledge. However, designing such a technique is difﬁcult given numerous challenges to be addressed. First, automatically ﬁnding a set of infor- mative elementary story pieces for building up a data story is usually difﬁcult. It not only requires a fast exploration in an enormous data space to create candidate facts, but also needs qualitative measure- ment to estimate the importance of each fact to make them compara- ble, enabling the selection of important story pieces.

The importance of the generated facts in each search step will be estimated by their information quantity, which is calculated based on the information theory [41] and their pattern signiﬁcance calculated based on auto-insight techniques [12, 46, 51].

We demonstrate the utility of the proposed system via three example stories generated based on real-world data, two controlled experiments designed to verify the generated logic, and a series of interviews with 10 expert users respectively from three areas, including data journalism, business intelligence, and the visu- alization research community. 2 R ELATED WORK In this section, we review the recent studies that are most relevant to our work, including data-driven storytelling, automatic data visualization, and natural language generation. 2.1 Data-Driven Storytelling Data-driven storytelling is a rapidly developing research direction that focuses on techniques for enhancing data understanding, information expression, and communication. Narrative visualization is one promis- ing approach frequently used for data-driven story telling [47]. Re- cently, the visualization community has extensively investigated sto- rytelling and narrative visualization techniques [40, 47]. According to Segel and Heer [40], narrative visualization can be largely classiﬁed into seven genres, including magazine style, annotated chart, parti- tioned poster, ﬂow chart, comic strip, slideshow, and video. Evidence shows that an effective composition and visual narrative of the story can guide readers through the data and improve the comprehension and memory [3, 20]. To compose effective data-driven stories, Hull- man et al. [20] identiﬁed several key design actions in the sequential story creation process, including context deﬁnition, facts selection, 1Calliope is available online at https://datacalliope.commodality selection, and order selection. Lee et al. also decomposed the creation process of a data-driven story into three major steps: insights ﬁnding, scripting, and communicating to the audience [23]."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"These valuable study results guide the designs of many data story creation systems including Calliope, which is introduced in this paper. Users commonly experience difﬁculty in creating a data-driven story due to technical barriers, which motivate the design and development of various authoring tools. General tools such as Ellipsis [37] allows a user to directly integrate visualizations to an illustrative story. Re- cent studies focus on designing tools to generate a speciﬁc type of visual narrative."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,narrative visualization,"Various authoring tools that are speciﬁcally designed to create narrative visualization for certain types of data. For example, Timeline Storyteller [4], is a visual storytelling tool designed speciﬁcally for time-oriented data. Several visualization tools are also introduced to bridge the gap between visual analysis and storytelling [6, 18], but they still target on expert users. The above tools assume that the story content is manually created, resulting in inefﬁciency."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"Inspired by DataShot, Calliope also borrowed the auto-insights techniques to generate data facts, but made a step further by organizing the facts in a logical order to generate a meaningful data story. 2.3 Natural Language Generation Recently, studies on natural language generation (NLG) demonstrate the capability of producing descriptive text from various types of data [16, 32, 48].

After that, we summarize the design requirements and introduce the architecture design of the system. 3.1 Data Story Data story is a set of story pieces that are meaningfully connected to support the author’s communication goal [23].

We design Calliope to automatically generate visual data stories by following this deﬁnition. Formally, a data story Sconsists of a sequence of data facts that are connected by coherent relations (denoted as ri∈ R){f1;r1;/uni22EF;fn−1;rn−1;fn}with each fact fi∈F. We will use these notations throughout the paper. 3.2 Preliminary Survey Before designing the system, it is necessary to understand how a data story is created by a human designer. To this end, as data video is a frequently used narrative visualization form, we collected a set of 602 data videos from YouTube and Vimeo by searching keywords, such as “animated infographic”, “data video”, and “motion infographic”. A total of 230 high-quality videos were selected and manually segmented into 4186 story pieces. The fact and chart types of 2583 data-related story pieces and the coherence relations used for connecting two succeeding pieces were labeled for analysis. Here, we borrowed the deﬁnition of fact types introduced in DataShot [51] and coherence relations intro- duced in [53, 54] to label our data."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"These results guide the design of the story generation algorithm and will be further described later. 3.3 System Design Our goal is to design a system that can automatically generate high- quality initial data stories directly from an input spreadsheet and support ﬂexible story editing functions to lower the technical barriers of creating a data story. To achieve this goal, a number of key requirements need to be fulﬁlled: R1 Generating “successful” stories. The most important thing for the system is to ensure the quality of story generation. Among various factors that contribute to a successful narrative artifact, the key is understandability [36], which is usually determined by the narrative logic, and the meaningful and believable con- tent [23]."

A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"The visual and textual repre- sentations of a data story should be probably aligned and adaptive laid out to ﬁt into different devices such as a laptop, tablets, and smartphones to facilitate an easy story exploration, communica- tion, and sharing. To fulﬁll these requirements, the design of Calliope system consists of two modules (Fig. 3): (1) the story generation engine and (2) the story editor. The story generation engine is designed based on a logic- oriented Monte Carlo tree search process, in which a story is gradually generated fact by fact while searching through the data space deﬁned by an input spreadsheet. The whole search process is guided by narrative logic and a reward function that measures the importance of facts to ensure the quality of the generated story ( R1)."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"The ﬁnal visual data story can be represented in three modes to ﬁt different devices (R5). 4 S TORY GENERATION ENGINE In this section, we ﬁrst formally deﬁne a data fact and its importance measurement. We then describe the details of the proposed automatic story generation algorithm. 4.1 Data Facts Data facts are the elementary building blocks of a data story. Each of these facts represents a piece of information extracted from the data. We ﬁrst give a formal deﬁnition of data facts by simplifying the concepts introduced in [7, 51] to guarantee a clear semantic and then introduce a novel method used to estimate the importance of a given data fact. Deﬁnition A data fact is designed to measure a collection of data items in a subspace of an input dataset based on a measurable data ﬁeld."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"Under this deﬁnition, the importance of a fact is only determined by its data content and irrelevant to how frequently a type of fact is used in data stories (Fig. 2(a)). 4.2 Story Generation Algorithm In Calliope, we introduce an intelligent algorithm that generates data facts from an input spreadsheet and threads them logically to create a meaningful data story. However designing such an algorithm is challenging. The story design space, formulated by a collection of data facts generated from the input spreadsheet, could be extremely large due to the huge number of possible combinations of the fact ﬁelds even based on a small dataset. The algorithm cannot generate all facts ﬁrst and then pick up those important ones to build the story as users cannot afford a long waiting time."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,A data story S={f1;r1;/uni22EF;fn−1;rn−1;fn} is thus represented by a path starting from the root. A reward function is designed to estimate the quality of each path in the tree. The reward scores are marked on the last node in paths. A node shared by multiple paths is weighted by the maximum reward.
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"Initially, it randomly generates a set of facts in types that are frequently used as the starting point in a data story (Fig. 2(b)). These facts usually reveal general and common data patterns which may already known by the audience as the background of the story. Among these facts, the most important one, denoted as f0, is used as the root of T. In the next, the algorithm generates a story by iteratively searching more informative and signif- icant data facts to elaborate the story via four major steps: selection , expansion ,simulation , and back-propagation ."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"The expansion should generate a set of nodes that is logically relevant to fito gradually generate a meaningful data story through the searching process. To this end, we investigated how a set of commonly used coherence relations (denoted as R) [53, 54] was used in data stories during our preliminary survey. As a result, Table 2 summarizes the likelihood, P(ri/divides.alt0fi), of each relation rioccurring after a fact firegarding to their fact types, which guides the node expansion process. In particular, during the expansion, we create a set of data facts regarding each coherence relation. The proportion of the newly generated facts is given by P(ri/divides.alt0fi), and each new fact, fi+1, is generated by the following rules: •Similarity indicates two succeeding facts are logically parallel to each other."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"The story editor of Calliope system consists of three major views: (1) the storyline view for story conﬁguration, generation, and storyline editing, (2) the fact view for fact editing, and (3) the story visualization view for the visual data story preview and sharing (factsheet mode). where the molecule is the total number of data items in the spread- sheet used in the story, and Nis the total number of data items. 5 D ATASTORY EDITOR In this section, we introduce the design of the story editor and the methods used for visualizing a data story. 5.1 User Interface The story editor, as shown in Fig. 5, consists of three major views: the storyline view (Fig. 5-1), fact view (Fig. 5-2), and story visualization view (Fig. 5-3). In the storyline view, a user can upload a spreadsheet, set the story generation goal, and adjust the reward function in a group of conﬁguration panels (Fig. 5-1(a)). The generated data facts are shown in a row (Fig. 5-1(b)), in which a user can remove a fact or change the generated narrative order based on his/her own preferences. Each fact is visualized by a chart and captioned by a generated text description ( R3)."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"The generated data story can be visualized in the story visualization view through three visualization modes: (1) storyline mode (Fig. 1), (2) swiper mode (Fig. 6(a)), and (3) factsheet mode (Fig. 6(b)). These modes are respectively designed for representing the story on laptops/tablets, smartphones, and printouts to facilitate a ﬂexible story communication and sharing ( R5). A user can easily switch between different modes in the story visualization view via a drop down menu. 5.2 Visualizing a Data Story A data story generated by the engine is visualized as a sequence of charts through two steps: showing a data fact andshowing a story. The ﬁrst step maps a data fact to a chart while the second step organizes a sequence of charts in an expressive layout as a story. Showing a Data Fact Beneﬁting from the simple and clear def- inition of each fact type introduced in Section 4.1, Calliope is able to directly convert a data fact into a captioned chart that incorporates both the visual and textual representations. Speciﬁcally, the caption is generated based on the syntax deﬁned in Table 3, and the fact is auto- matically visualized in two steps by following a rule-based approach."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"Fig. 5(2) illustrates an example of showing a difference fact in a captioned bar chart.Showing a Story The story visualization view provides a variety of visualization modes to represent the generated data story for different application scenarios. In particular, a summarization is ﬁrst provided to give a textual brieﬁng of the story to help users obtain data insights at a glance. This step shows the data coverage rate, the total number of data facts in the story, and the generated textual narrative of the story. Thestoryline andswiper visualization modes are respectively designed to facilitate an efﬁcient story exploration on tablets and smartphones."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data stories,"Finally, the factsheet mode is designed to show the story in the form of a poster that could be easily printed out. 6 E VALUATION We evaluate Calliope system via (1) three examples to showcase the quality of the generated story, (2) two controlled experiments to esti- mate the usefulness and quality of a generated logic, and (3) domain expert interviews to estimate the usability of the system. 6.1 Example Stories We demonstrate three visual data stories generated by Calliope respec- tively based on three real-world datasets as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 6, which are described as follows: Fig. 1 shows a story generated based on a COVID-19 dataset (903 rows, 5 columns). The data record the recent numbers of daily infec- tions, deaths, and healings of COVID-19 in China from March 1st to March 21st. The generated story illustrates the daily mortality in China decreased in March (Fact 1), and the largest number was 42 occurred on March 2nd (Fact 2). Hubei was the most affected province (Fact 3)."

Procedure and Tasks. We recruited 16 college students (12 females) ages 22 - 26 years old (M=23.94, SD=1.43) as participants."
A12,Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet,1,1,data story,"We ﬁrst shufﬂed the order of a set of data facts in a visual data story generated by Calliope and then asked a group of users to restore the logic order by reading the chart and description of each fact. Finally, we checked the consistency between the human-generated logic orders and those produced by Calliope based on Kendall’s tbcorrelation [22]. This measure was introduced to estimate the consistency of the element orders between two sequences, whose value lies in [−1; 1]with “-1” indicating a completely reverse order and “1” indicating the orders are identical. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we generated 12 data stories based onthe aforementioned three datasets, four stories per dataset. Each story contained six data facts whose orders were shufﬂed for the experiment. A group of 20 participants (17 female) aged 22-30 years old ( M= 26;SD=2:63) were recruited for Experiment II. All of the participants reported that they have fundamental knowledge about data visualization or experience in data-oriented storytelling."

We hope highlight these limitations will help point out several potential future research directions and inspire new studies by following our work. Supporting a Better Textual Narrative. During the interview, many data journalists (J1,J2,J4) felt the generated captions were too rigid to be used especially in a data news. More diverse and insightful descriptions were desired. Moreover, the current results also contained some grammar errors, which also need to be addressed (J1,2 D1, V2,3)). However, all of them acknowledged that the current results, although unsatisfactory, were still useful for a rapid preview and brieﬁng of the input data."

Understanding Data Semantics. After using Calliope, although im- pressed, some experts (J1-J3, V2) expect a more intelligent tool that can even understand the semantics of the data to better generate the story content and logic. We acknowledge this is a key limitation of the current system and understanding the underlying semantics of the data is critical for generating a meaningful and insightful data story. This is a promising research direction that is worth a further exploration. To address the issue, one could leverage or develop more advanced AI techniques or could also introduce sophisticated interactive feedback mechanism to keep user in the generation loop and leverage human in- telligence to steer data quality [27] and guide the underlying generation algorithm/model to better understand data semantics.

They are used across a range of scientiﬁc disciplines to analyze phenomena, such as changes in microbiomes and shifts in climate. There have been several large-scale efforts to develop scientiﬁc and information visualizations for the public: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Science on a Sphere presents earth systems datasets such as tsunamis, climate models, and sea surface temper-ature on a large spherical display for aquariums and museums [52]; DeepTree [8] visualizes evolutionary data for exploration on a tabletop interface in natural history museums; MacroScope [69] ports a range of visualizations into a large interactive display for a wide range ofacademic and museum settings; and Living Liquid [34, 45] created interactive visualizations for a hands-on museum environment.

This has resulted in design principles being proposed for data-driven storytelling, and new authoring tools being created to aid such storytelling. However, data analysts typically lack sufﬁcient background in design and storytelling to make effective use of these principles and authoring tools. To assist this process, we present ChartStory for crafting data stories from a collection of user- created charts, using a style akin to comic panels to imply the underlying sequence and logic of data-driven narratives. Our approach is to operationalize established design principles into an advanced pipeline that characterizes charts by their properties and similarities to each other, and recommends ways to partition, layout, and caption story pieces to serve a narrative. ChartStory also augments this pipeline with intuitive user interactions for visual reﬁnement of generated data comics. We extensively and holistically evaluate ChartStory via a trio of studies."
A15,"ChartStory: Automated Partitioning, Layout, and Captioning of Charts into Comic-Style Narratives",1,1,data storytelling,"Index Terms— Data story generation, narrative visualization, data-driven storytelling, data comics Ç 1I NTRODUCTION VISUAL data storytelling concerns the communication of data insights and narratives to general audiences using engaging visualizations. The notion of “visual data story” [28] includes the discovery of interesting information in data as “story pieces,” the representation of them using visualiza- tions and annotations, and the sequencing of these represen- tations into a narrative to communicate a high-level goal. When designed well, visual stories can greatly improve the comprehension of data even among laypeople. However, the creation of visual data stories can be espe- cially difﬁcult for a general data analyst, who is familiarwith the data, but often has little background in art or design. Research on computational notebooks highlights the tension between exploration —conducted at a personal scale with messy results—and explanation —where results are cleaned up at the expense of provenance [23], [36], [45]. There is a need for an intermediate step to mitigate this ten- sion. One main challenge is identifying a narrative—con- verting the analysis results (e.g., a collection of charts) into a compelling story that resonates with the reader and reveals a logical progression of ideas."
A15,"ChartStory: Automated Partitioning, Layout, and Captioning of Charts into Comic-Style Narratives",1,1,data storytelling,"The second is presenting the narrative—arranging the charts and textual annotations by leveraging design principles drawn from research on visual data storytelling. There exist theoretical frameworks to generate a narra- tive from a set of charts [22], [28]. Yet, no satisfactory approach has been proposed to operationalize these theo- ries. Interactive authoring tools for presenting a narrative in through expressive visualizations [38], [54], annotations [35], and comic-style storyboards [24] also exist, but require much manual input and learning, and lack support for auto- mated narrative identiﬁcation or presentation."
A15,"ChartStory: Automated Partitioning, Layout, and Captioning of Charts into Comic-Style Narratives",1,1,data stories,"In contrast, several works focus on automatically generating speciﬁc types of visual data stories such as “fact sheets” directly from data tables [13], [41], [49]. However, they are mainly designed for a general audience, not data analysts who wish to fully control the analysis and only automate the nar- rative generation. These tools also focus on automated grouping and sequencing of charts based on similarity measures and edit distances, but seldom incorporate theo- retical considerations of general narrative such as story pieces [22] and comic-style narrative [8] (see Fig. 2).

A15,"ChartStory: Automated Partitioning, Layout, and Captioning of Charts into Comic-Style Narratives",1,1,data storytelling,"To ﬁll in the gap, we address the challenges of identify- ing and presenting a narrative through ChartStory, a tool that helps analysts automatically generate data comics —a major genre of visual data storytelling—from an ensemble of charts created during exploratory data analysis (Fig. 1a). As an initial step, we consider data comics, ﬁrst deﬁned by Zhao et al. [ 58, p. 2], as “ multiple visualizations (juxtaposed) into comic strip layouts consisting of a sequence of panels, each appropriately annotated and decorated with both visual and tex- tual elements, and arranged into a sequence that progressively develops the overarching story told in the comic, ” although tra- ditional comic strips might include more embellishments. ChartStory operationalizes a set of design requirements that we term Granularity ,Relatedness ,Explanation , and Presenta- tion(GREP), synthesized from prior research in visual data storytelling [22], [28]. It generates data comics by identify- ing “story pieces” [28] from the ensemble of charts (Fig. 1b), organizing story pieces in a layout based on data comic design patterns [8] (Fig. 1c), and generating natural-lan- guage captions to explain detected data facts (Fig. 1d)."
A15,"ChartStory: Automated Partitioning, Layout, and Captioning of Charts into Comic-Style Narratives",1,1,data-driven storytelling,"In summary, our contributions in this paper include: 1) A set of requirements (abbreviated as GREP) derived from prior work [22], [25], [28] to operationalize data-driven storytelling, 2) An automated pipeline that operationalizes GREP, as well as an interactive system named ChartStory , for partitioning, layout, and captioning an ensemble of charts to generate a data comic, and 3) An evaluation that illustrates the value of our approach to both data comic creators and consumers.

Thomas & Cook recommended that effective tools require production ,presentation , and dissemina- tion[46]. Many of the existing tools focus mainly on produc- tion, rather than presentation and dissemination."

Several works focused on theoretical conceptualizations of these intents. For instance, General- ized Space-Time Cubes [5] displays both existing and unre- alized temporal narrative designs as a projection, ﬂattening, or unfolding of a space-time hypercube. Brehmer et al. [10] proposed a design space for timeline-based storytelling using as dimensions the layout, scale, and representation of the narrative."
A15,"ChartStory: Automated Partitioning, Layout, and Captioning of Charts into Comic-Style Narratives",1,1,narrative visualization,"Ellipsis [37], another authoring tool, helps create interactive narrative visualizations as a combi- nation of scenes, annotations, and user interactions. Our approach is similar in this aspect: the system automatically develops “story pieces” [28] based on the input set of charts or visualizations (i.e., partitioning). Data comics speciﬁcally have been identiﬁed as a form that—through the combination of familiarity, established conventions, and potential for expressive freedom—can serve as an effective medium to engage the reader, convey complexity, and enable decision making [7], [50]. Bach et al. [6] used graph-based storytelling exercises to identify design factors for creating what they call “graph comics”."
A15,"ChartStory: Automated Partitioning, Layout, and Captioning of Charts into Comic-Style Narratives",1,1,data story,"Our work is close to Datatoon in the applica- tion area, with the following main differences: (1) ChartStory is an automated data comic generation system, while theirs is an authoring tool focusing more on expressivity, and (2) ChartStory can form narratives from any set of data charts provided they are derived from the same dataset, while theirs only focuses on narration of graph-based visualizations. 2.3 Data Story Generation and Presentation There has been a movement in the digital humanities to pro- vide an orthogonal classiﬁcation system that categorizes dif- ferent artists and the layouts of their works [9]. On the otherend, algorithmic and graphical approaches have focused on generative aspects, such as identifying keyframes from a con- tinuous ﬁlm to select and lay out a comic-book “adaptation” [15] or simply generating, scaling, and placing text annota- tions within a comic [14]. These approaches have not been limited to comics. Computational support in the form of suggestions and reﬁnements has also been pursued in graphic design."
A15,"ChartStory: Automated Partitioning, Layout, and Captioning of Charts into Comic-Style Narratives",1,1,narrative visualization,"Within narrative visualization, the interest has tended towards methodological and algorithmic approaches for sequence detection, layout design, and caption (or annota- tion) generation. A general comparison between ChartStory and existing key systems for generating narrative visualiza- tions is provided in Fig. 2. GraphScape [25] suggests a sequence of narration by computing a cost based on chart transitions, data ﬁltering operations, and people’s prefer- ence for consistent chart subsequences. ChartStory differs from GraphScape in several aspects (Fig. 2): (1) ChartStory leverages Hullman et al. ’s theory [22] and chart transition cost to cluster charts and generate story pieces, which is not considered in GraphScape; (2) ChartStory further lays out the story pieces based on data comics design patterns [8], instead of a linear sequence."

Based on these principles, we identify a set of requirements that we term GREP (Fig. 3)— Granularity, Relatedness, Explanation, and Presentation—for designing an automated system that generates data comics [58] from a set of user-cre- ated charts to present a visual data story [28]. In articulating these requirements, we use the term “panel” in the sense of a panel in a comic book, but more speciﬁcally as a combination of asingle chart with annotations and/or text explanation(s), contained as one unit. GRANULARITY :Stories can be separated into microstructures [47]. In narrative visualization, speciﬁc facts supported by data are what form the microstructure. These facts or sets of facts are called “story pieces” [28] and would form the “sequence of panels” in Zhao et al.’s [58] deﬁnition of data comics. The system should identify individual story pieces based on data variables, markup, and/or visualrepresentations extracted from a collection of charts resulted from data analysis. RELATEDNESS :In contrast to microstructures, links relating events to each other form macrostructures [47]."

The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely inﬂuence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag’s Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in ﬁlm and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag’s Pyramid to data stories, little systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag’s Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag’s Pyramid by analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our ﬁndings, we proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data ﬂows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through story creation. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"Results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag’s Pyramid. Index Terms—Freytag’s Pyramid, Narrative Structure, Narrative Visualization, Data Storytelling, Data Video 1I NTRODUCTION Data stories integrate various visual content (e.g., text, visualization, and animation) to tell stories that convey data insights [56]. To create expressive data stories, designers carefully plan the narrative structures of their stories. According to prior research, the narrative structure of a story can affect the audience’s perception, understanding, and memory of it [33]. The narrative structure also inﬂuences the considerations of visual design. For example, in visual storytelling, it is considered beneﬁcial to use high-energy colors or to increase the movement speed of the camera in the climax of a story to elicit tension [11]."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"There has been an increasing interest in studying the narrative struc- tures of data stories [33, 34, 46, 56]. For example, Segel and Heer [56] identiﬁed three high-level structures (i.e., Martini Glass Structure, In- teractive Slideshow, and Drill-Down Story) that provide readers with various levels of control over the manipulation of the story presentation in interactive visualizations. In recent years, the visualization commu- nity has also been actively studying the potential of using Freytag’s Pyramid and its variations in data storytelling [2, 24, 27, 50]. Freytag’s Pyramid [29] is a classic narrative structure that has been widely applied in ﬁlm and literature [25, 29]. Adhering to this structure, a story starts with introducing the setting, develops with a progressive increase of the tension that reaches the highest point at the climax, and is followed by falling tension until the end of the story. Similar structures have been found in data stories. Based on the four major narrative categories (i.e., Establisher (E), Initial (I), Peak (P), and Release (R)) that Cohn et al. [23] redeﬁned through an analogy with traditional narrative struc- tures, Amini et al. [2] coded the structures of 50 data videos and found the dominant sequence “E+I+PR+” that closely resembled Freytag’s •Leni Yang is with Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"Furthermore, Dykes [27] proposed the Data Storytelling Arc model for telling data stories to drive business decisions based on Frey- tag’s Pyramid. Although these studies provide summaries regarding applying Freytag’s Pyramid to data stories, little systematic work exists on how to create an expressive data story with Freytag’s Pyramid. To ﬁll this gap, this work introduces a design space that concludes story patterns in key stages of Freytag’s Pyramid—the Setting, the Rising-Climax, and the Resolution—regarding three dimensions: (1) narrative pattern that provides narrative devices as initial ideas to assist in the creative process, (2) data ﬂow that provides strategies for selecting and organizing individual story pieces (i.e., facts backed up by data) to achieve a narrative pattern, and (3) visual communication that supports selecting visual design strategies to enhance the presentation of a narrative pattern. We systematically analyzed 103 high-quality data videos using the Freytag’s Pyramid structure to derive the design space. While there are various genres of narrative visualization such as Magazine Style, Slide Show, and Annotated Charts [56], we narrowed down our analysis to data videos. Data videos, as one kind of author- driven data stories [56], have a linear path through the story and can represent the intention of the creators. Moreover, the design of videos covers diverse visual forms that assist us in extracting abundant design strategies which could be applied to other storytelling forms. To evaluate the effectiveness of our design space, we conducted a workshop with 25 participants. The participants were invited to create data stories using Freytag’s Pyramid. They were initially asked to create story outlines without our design space ﬁrst, and they later reﬁned their story outlines and accomplished their stories using ourdesign space. We also provided a set of method cards derived from our design space as teaching material. The method cards provided the deﬁnition, a case example, and a GIF demo for each category in ourdesign space, and they can be found on our website ( 1)."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"The results of the workshop showed that our design space provided an efﬁcientframework for participants to select, organize, and ﬁll data facts into different stages of Freytag’s Pyramid while at the same time supporting the design of visual content throughout the structure. 2B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK In this section, we introduce how Freytag’s Pyramid is adapted to data stories and review relevant research on narrative visualization. 2.1 Freytag’s Pyramid for Data Stories Narrative structure is essential to the expressiveness and the audience’s perception of a story [33]. Representative narrative structures have 1https://pyramidstory.idvxlab.com/emerged across different domains such as drama, literature, and cin- ematography. Some structures conclude typical story plots in certaintypes of stories (e.g., [13, 20, 52]). For example, Campbell [20] pro- posed the Hero’s journey structure, which deﬁnes 17 common stages in hero myth narratives such as “The Call to Adventure” and “Refusal of the Call”."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"Despite the variety of other narrative structures mentioned above and structures for other genres (e.g., the inverted pyramid for news [51] and essay structures [68]), we choose to focus our research on Freytag’s Pyramid for data stories, given its popularity in the visualization com- munity discourse [24, 27, 50, 61] and in data stories [2]. In particular, Cohn [23] identiﬁed four major narrative categories (i.e., Establisher (E),Initial (I), Peak (P), and Release (R)) that were reﬁned from the stages of Freytag’s Pyramid and other dramatic structures to analyzethe structure of visual narratives. He further found that the canonical “E-I-P-R” sequence closely resembles Freytag’s Pyramid. Following Cohn’s theory, Amini et al. [2] analyzed 50 professional data videos andfound that “E-I-P-R” is the most common structure."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"Based on Freytag’sPyramid, Dykes [27] proposed a model called Data Storytelling Arc for telling data stories to drive business decisions. Dykes’s model includesfour stages: the Setting stage gives background information; the Rising insights stage goes into deeper analysis, which serves as the build-up for the Aha moment ; the Aha moment reveals the main ﬁndings and central insights; and ﬁnally, the Solution and Next Steps. These studies have shed light on applying Freytag’s Pyramid in data storytelling. However, little systematic guidance is available for story creators on how to apply Freytag’s Pyramid to data stories considering the creation process of a data story such as how to organize story pieces (i.e., facts backed up by data) and design visual content throughout the structure. Our work ﬁlls this gap by extracting story patterns from existing data stories with that structure. Notably, the four most observed narrative stages we identiﬁed from analyzing data stories align well with Cohn’s “E-I-P-R” structure. To better capture the progression of story ﬂows and simplify our design space, we further merged the Rising action andClimax stages as the Rising-Climax stage, considering that theClimax stage is not a standalone point in the story model but rather a culmination or the conﬂuence of events in the Rising action [2]. For example, a story may present data facts in the Climax stage that have a substantial difference with that in the Rising action to create a twist, which usually leads to a climax. The relationship between data facts in these two stages is difﬁcult to identify if they are not analyzed together."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"Speciﬁcally, our design space considers the following narrative stages: •Setting: This stage provides contextual information of the data story and grabs the audience’s attention. •Rising-Climax: This stage builds the tension of the story and shows supporting facts that lead to the climax, which presents the central insights of the story. •Resolution: This stage gives conclusions and take-away mes- sages. 2.2 Guidance on Narrative Visualizations Researchers in the visualization community have attempted to pro- vide theoretical bases and guidance for narrative visualizations. Segel and Heer [56] initiated the ﬁrst step in constructing a design space of narrative visualization with three dimensions, namely, genre, visualnarrative, and visual structuring. In addition, they proposed to struc- ture data stories along a spectrum of author-driven and reader-driven approaches. They also discussed three structures—Martini Glass Struc- ture, Interactive Slideshow, and Drill-Down Story—that use a mix of the author-driven and reader-driven approaches. Our work went intoa deeper analysis of data videos, a typical form of author-driven data stories, that speciﬁcally use Freytag’s Pyramid. We present more con- crete design techniques tailored to stories with this structure."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"The ﬁrst category of research focuses on the visual design strategies of narrative visualizations. Segel and Heer [56] ﬁrst identiﬁed sevengenres of narrative visualizations, including Film/Video/Animation, Magazine Style, Slide Show, Flow Chart, Comic Strip, Annotated Chart, andPartitioned Poster. Subsequently, design spaces are proposed re- garding different genres (e.g., [9, 18, 39, 60, 64]). There are also studies on how to use visual embellishments to strengthen viewers’ attention and memory (e.g., [10,15, 16,22,32]). Studies on visual design strate- gies of data videos are most relevant to our work."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"Under this category, some studies surveyed structures used in data stories. Kosara [38] proposed an argument structure for data stories. Based on the analysis of time-orientated data stories, Lan et al. [40] concluded ﬁve narrative order patterns that are different fromthe linear order of story events. Other research under this category gaveﬁne-grained guidance on how to improve the ﬂexibility and smoothness of data story structures. McKenna et al. [46] identiﬁed and investi-gated seven ﬂow-factors (e.g., navigation input, level of control, andnavigation progress) that affect the reading experience on interactivedata stories. For visualization stories in the form of a sequence of visualizations, Hullman et al. [33] summarized six transition types between adjacent visualizations. In a follow-up work, they found that people prefer hierarchical structures of visualization sequences that group visualizations with shared data properties, such as time period, measure, and spatial region [34]. To sum up, the structures used in data stories are diverse. Although these works contribute to increasing the expressiveness of narrative visualization structures, they do notfully explore the storytelling techniques for structures. We hope our work can complement the current research to increase the expressive- ness of narrative visualization structures and inspire future works that investigate other structures. 3C ASE ANALYSIS This section presents three cases from our corpus to give a preview of how the concepts in our design space (i.e., narrative stages, data ﬂows, and visual communications) are presented in data stories, and how we deconstruct data stories in our analysis.

A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"A Design Space for Applying the Freytag’s Pyramid Structure to Data Stories Leni Yang, Xian Xu, XingYu Lan, Ziyan Liu, Shunan Guo, Yang Shi, Huamin Qu, and Nan Cao Abstract — Data stories integrate compelling visual content to communicate data insights in the form of narratives. The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely inﬂuence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag’s Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in ﬁlm and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag’s Pyramid to data stories, little systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag’s Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag’s Pyramid by analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our ﬁndings, we proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data ﬂows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through story creation. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"Results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag’s Pyramid. Index Terms—Freytag’s Pyramid, Narrative Structure, Narrative Visualization, Data Storytelling, Data Video 1I NTRODUCTION Data stories integrate various visual content (e.g., text, visualization, and animation) to tell stories that convey data insights [56]. To create expressive data stories, designers carefully plan the narrative structures of their stories. According to prior research, the narrative structure of a story can affect the audience’s perception, understanding, and memory of it [33]. The narrative structure also inﬂuences the considerations of visual design. For example, in visual storytelling, it is considered beneﬁcial to use high-energy colors or to increase the movement speed of the camera in the climax of a story to elicit tension [11]."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"There has been an increasing interest in studying the narrative struc- tures of data stories [33, 34, 46, 56]. For example, Segel and Heer [56] identiﬁed three high-level structures (i.e., Martini Glass Structure, In- teractive Slideshow, and Drill-Down Story) that provide readers with various levels of control over the manipulation of the story presentation in interactive visualizations. In recent years, the visualization commu- nity has also been actively studying the potential of using Freytag’s Pyramid and its variations in data storytelling [2, 24, 27, 50]. Freytag’s Pyramid [29] is a classic narrative structure that has been widely applied in ﬁlm and literature [25, 29]. Adhering to this structure, a story starts with introducing the setting, develops with a progressive increase of the tension that reaches the highest point at the climax, and is followed by falling tension until the end of the story. Similar structures have been found in data stories. Based on the four major narrative categories (i.e., Establisher (E), Initial (I), Peak (P), and Release (R)) that Cohn et al. [23] redeﬁned through an analogy with traditional narrative struc- tures, Amini et al. [2] coded the structures of 50 data videos and found the dominant sequence “E+I+PR+” that closely resembled Freytag’s •Leni Yang is with Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab at Tongji University and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"Furthermore, Dykes [27] proposed the Data Storytelling Arc model for telling data stories to drive business decisions based on Frey- tag’s Pyramid. Although these studies provide summaries regarding applying Freytag’s Pyramid to data stories, little systematic work exists on how to create an expressive data story with Freytag’s Pyramid. To ﬁll this gap, this work introduces a design space that concludes story patterns in key stages of Freytag’s Pyramid—the Setting, the Rising-Climax, and the Resolution—regarding three dimensions: (1) narrative pattern that provides narrative devices as initial ideas to assist in the creative process, (2) data ﬂow that provides strategies for selecting and organizing individual story pieces (i.e., facts backed up by data) to achieve a narrative pattern, and (3) visual communication that supports selecting visual design strategies to enhance the presentation of a narrative pattern. We systematically analyzed 103 high-quality data videos using the Freytag’s Pyramid structure to derive the design space. While there are various genres of narrative visualization such as Magazine Style, Slide Show, and Annotated Charts [56], we narrowed down our analysis to data videos. Data videos, as one kind of author- driven data stories [56], have a linear path through the story and can represent the intention of the creators. Moreover, the design of videos covers diverse visual forms that assist us in extracting abundant design strategies which could be applied to other storytelling forms. To evaluate the effectiveness of our design space, we conducted a workshop with 25 participants. The participants were invited to create data stories using Freytag’s Pyramid. They were initially asked to create story outlines without our design space ﬁrst, and they later reﬁned their story outlines and accomplished their stories using ourdesign space. We also provided a set of method cards derived from our design space as teaching material. The method cards provided the deﬁnition, a case example, and a GIF demo for each category in ourdesign space, and they can be found on our website ( 1)."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"The results of the workshop showed that our design space provided an efﬁcientframework for participants to select, organize, and ﬁll data facts into different stages of Freytag’s Pyramid while at the same time supporting the design of visual content throughout the structure. 2B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK In this section, we introduce how Freytag’s Pyramid is adapted to data stories and review relevant research on narrative visualization. 2.1 Freytag’s Pyramid for Data Stories Narrative structure is essential to the expressiveness and the audience’s perception of a story [33]. Representative narrative structures have 1https://pyramidstory.idvxlab.com/emerged across different domains such as drama, literature, and cin- ematography. Some structures conclude typical story plots in certaintypes of stories (e.g., [13, 20, 52]). For example, Campbell [20] pro- posed the Hero’s journey structure, which deﬁnes 17 common stages in hero myth narratives such as “The Call to Adventure” and “Refusal of the Call”."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"Despite the variety of other narrative structures mentioned above and structures for other genres (e.g., the inverted pyramid for news [51] and essay structures [68]), we choose to focus our research on Freytag’s Pyramid for data stories, given its popularity in the visualization com- munity discourse [24, 27, 50, 61] and in data stories [2]. In particular, Cohn [23] identiﬁed four major narrative categories (i.e., Establisher (E),Initial (I), Peak (P), and Release (R)) that were reﬁned from the stages of Freytag’s Pyramid and other dramatic structures to analyzethe structure of visual narratives. He further found that the canonical “E-I-P-R” sequence closely resembles Freytag’s Pyramid. Following Cohn’s theory, Amini et al. [2] analyzed 50 professional data videos andfound that “E-I-P-R” is the most common structure."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"Based on Freytag’sPyramid, Dykes [27] proposed a model called Data Storytelling Arc for telling data stories to drive business decisions. Dykes’s model includesfour stages: the Setting stage gives background information; the Rising insights stage goes into deeper analysis, which serves as the build-up for the Aha moment ; the Aha moment reveals the main ﬁndings and central insights; and ﬁnally, the Solution and Next Steps. These studies have shed light on applying Freytag’s Pyramid in data storytelling. However, little systematic guidance is available for story creators on how to apply Freytag’s Pyramid to data stories considering the creation process of a data story such as how to organize story pieces (i.e., facts backed up by data) and design visual content throughout the structure. Our work ﬁlls this gap by extracting story patterns from existing data stories with that structure. Notably, the four most observed narrative stages we identiﬁed from analyzing data stories align well with Cohn’s “E-I-P-R” structure. To better capture the progression of story ﬂows and simplify our design space, we further merged the Rising action andClimax stages as the Rising-Climax stage, considering that theClimax stage is not a standalone point in the story model but rather a culmination or the conﬂuence of events in the Rising action [2]. For example, a story may present data facts in the Climax stage that have a substantial difference with that in the Rising action to create a twist, which usually leads to a climax. The relationship between data facts in these two stages is difﬁcult to identify if they are not analyzed together."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"Speciﬁcally, our design space considers the following narrative stages: •Setting: This stage provides contextual information of the data story and grabs the audience’s attention. •Rising-Climax: This stage builds the tension of the story and shows supporting facts that lead to the climax, which presents the central insights of the story. •Resolution: This stage gives conclusions and take-away mes- sages. 2.2 Guidance on Narrative Visualizations Researchers in the visualization community have attempted to pro- vide theoretical bases and guidance for narrative visualizations. Segel and Heer [56] initiated the ﬁrst step in constructing a design space of narrative visualization with three dimensions, namely, genre, visualnarrative, and visual structuring. In addition, they proposed to struc- ture data stories along a spectrum of author-driven and reader-driven approaches. They also discussed three structures—Martini Glass Struc- ture, Interactive Slideshow, and Drill-Down Story—that use a mix of the author-driven and reader-driven approaches. Our work went intoa deeper analysis of data videos, a typical form of author-driven data stories, that speciﬁcally use Freytag’s Pyramid. We present more con- crete design techniques tailored to stories with this structure."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"The ﬁrst category of research focuses on the visual design strategies of narrative visualizations. Segel and Heer [56] ﬁrst identiﬁed sevengenres of narrative visualizations, including Film/Video/Animation, Magazine Style, Slide Show, Flow Chart, Comic Strip, Annotated Chart, andPartitioned Poster. Subsequently, design spaces are proposed re- garding different genres (e.g., [9, 18, 39, 60, 64]). There are also studies on how to use visual embellishments to strengthen viewers’ attention and memory (e.g., [10,15, 16,22,32]). Studies on visual design strate- gies of data videos are most relevant to our work."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"Under this category, some studies surveyed structures used in data stories. Kosara [38] proposed an argument structure for data stories. Based on the analysis of time-orientated data stories, Lan et al. [40] concluded ﬁve narrative order patterns that are different fromthe linear order of story events. Other research under this category gaveﬁne-grained guidance on how to improve the ﬂexibility and smoothness of data story structures. McKenna et al. [46] identiﬁed and investi-gated seven ﬂow-factors (e.g., navigation input, level of control, andnavigation progress) that affect the reading experience on interactivedata stories. For visualization stories in the form of a sequence of visualizations, Hullman et al. [33] summarized six transition types between adjacent visualizations. In a follow-up work, they found that people prefer hierarchical structures of visualization sequences that group visualizations with shared data properties, such as time period, measure, and spatial region [34]. To sum up, the structures used in data stories are diverse. Although these works contribute to increasing the expressiveness of narrative visualization structures, they do notfully explore the storytelling techniques for structures. We hope our work can complement the current research to increase the expressive- ness of narrative visualization structures and inspire future works that investigate other structures. 3C ASE ANALYSIS This section presents three cases from our corpus to give a preview of how the concepts in our design space (i.e., narrative stages, data ﬂows, and visual communications) are presented in data stories, and how we deconstruct data stories in our analysis.

For instance, the climax in a literary story often accompanies a plot of a ﬁerce confrontation between the protagonist and the antagonist.

A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"The datasets we used in the workshop for participants to create data stories related to two topics of general interest: top 10 killer diseases in the world and the obesity problem in the world. Given the diversity of data facts we observed in the two datasets, we hypothesized that they could lead to various stories. Following the suggestions from previous studies [2, 9, 59], instead of giving participants only the raw data, we also provided various categories of pre-extracted data facts (e.g., outlier, rank, and distribution [67]) and their corresponding visualizations to focus participants’ attention on planning narrative strategies. 5.3 Procedure and Analysis Approach The workshop was conducted ofﬂine and lasted about four hours. We began with a 30 minute introduction to narrative visualization, Freytag’s Pyramid, and the storyboard for planning a story. After the introduction, participants were divided into 12 groups of two to three people on a voluntary basis. Each group was asked to create stories with Freytag’s Pyramid based on either the given datasets or any online dataset. To thoroughly investigate how our design space could help story creators construct data stories, we gave each group of participants 40 minutes to explore the dataset and create a story outline with key points ineach stage of Freytag’s Pyramid before using the design space. Eachgroup of participants wrote down their story outlines. Afterward, wegave a 15 minute demonstration on how to use our design space and method cards. Participants were then asked to reﬁne their story outlines using our design space freely."

Interview questions were centered around: (1) their opinions on using Freytag’s Pyramid for data stories; (2) the difﬁculties they encountered whendrafting the story outlines without the design space; (3) whether and, if applicable, how our design space helped improve their stories; and (4) their comments on the usefulness and clarity of the design spaceand our teaching materials. Each interview took approximately 10-15 minutes, and audio was recorded for subsequent analysis. Two authors independently coded the story outlines and storyboards collected from participants to investigate what items from our design space were used by each group. Speciﬁcally, we classiﬁed frames of each storyboard into different stages of Freytag’s Pyramid and coded narrative patterns, data ﬂows, and visual communications that were used in each stage."

Before the workshop, 24 %of the participants had never heard of Freytag’s Pyramid, 60 %knew simi- lar concepts, 8 %heard of this structure, 4 %were familiar with this structure, and 4% often used it.5.2 Teaching Materials and Data During the workshop, we provided a set of method cards as the teaching material of our design space. All method cards are available on our website. The design of the method cards was inspired by the Napa Cards [43] and IDEO Method Cards [35]."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"The datasets we used in the workshop for participants to create data stories related to two topics of general interest: top 10 killer diseases in the world and the obesity problem in the world. Given the diversity of data facts we observed in the two datasets, we hypothesized that they could lead to various stories. Following the suggestions from previous studies [2, 9, 59], instead of giving participants only the raw data, we also provided various categories of pre-extracted data facts (e.g., outlier, rank, and distribution [67]) and their corresponding visualizations to focus participants’ attention on planning narrative strategies. 5.3 Procedure and Analysis Approach The workshop was conducted ofﬂine and lasted about four hours. We began with a 30 minute introduction to narrative visualization, Freytag’s Pyramid, and the storyboard for planning a story. After the introduction, participants were divided into 12 groups of two to three people on a voluntary basis. Each group was asked to create stories with Freytag’s Pyramid based on either the given datasets or any online dataset. To thoroughly investigate how our design space could help story creators construct data stories, we gave each group of participants 40 minutes to explore the dataset and create a story outline with key points ineach stage of Freytag’s Pyramid before using the design space. Eachgroup of participants wrote down their story outlines. Afterward, wegave a 15 minute demonstration on how to use our design space and method cards. Participants were then asked to reﬁne their story outlines using our design space freely."
A17,A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"We also conducted semi-structured interviews with the participants for their feedback on using Freytag’s Pyramid and the design space fordata stories once a group ﬁnished drawing. Some interviews wereconducted after the workshop through online meetings. Interview questions were centered around: (1) their opinions on using Freytag’s Pyramid for data stories; (2) the difﬁculties they encountered whendrafting the story outlines without the design space; (3) whether and, if applicable, how our design space helped improve their stories; and (4) their comments on the usefulness and clarity of the design spaceand our teaching materials. Each interview took approximately 10-15 minutes, and audio was recorded for subsequent analysis. Two authors independently coded the story outlines and storyboards collected from participants to investigate what items from our design space were used by each group. Speciﬁcally, we classiﬁed frames of each storyboard into different stages of Freytag’s Pyramid and coded narrative patterns, data ﬂows, and visual communications that were used in each stage."

We examined the usefulness of our design space by comparing the story outlines that participants made before and after using the design space.

When formalizing the design space, we found that many techniques in data stories can be mapped to traditional storytellingforms. For example, in ﬁlm and literature, the climax is often built through a ﬁerce confrontation, while in data stories, the climax is usu- ally built by showing contrasting data facts. However, we noticed that creating data stories faces unique challenges compared with traditional stories. For example, data as the main “character” of data stories is more abstract than traditional characters, which makes crafting a mean- ingful and understandable narrative structure difﬁcult. In our workshop, some participants found selecting data facts from the dataset and ar- ranging them into an engaging plot difﬁcult before they were given the design space. Our design space alleviates this problem by guiding the selection and organization of data facts. 6.2 The Generalizability of the Design Space This section discusses the generalizability of our design space. We start by discussing how our design space can be applied to other genres of narrative visualization [56] in addition to data videos. First, our resultst can be easily generalized to Magazine Style and Slide Show because these two forms use a linear storyline where Freytag’s Pyramid can be applied. The visual design strategies in our design space can be smoothly applied in these two genres with visual elements such as text, images, and animation that are covered by data videos.

Future work may consider conducting a deeper analysis of how the temporal order ofdata facts can be used together with Freytag’s Pyramid by collecting data stories with the two structures. 6.3 How Designers Structure Data Stories When selecting data facts for the narrative structure, designers consider the emotional value of the data apart from their logic connections, as participant G3P2 noted, “We tried to ﬁnd which data facts are most sur- prising to the audience ﬁrst. ” Similarly, some participants mentioned that they arranged data facts in a way that built anticipation or created suspense. We also found that the participants generally put much effort into attracting audiences at the beginning of the story.

However, how to design affective data stories remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate one speciﬁc design factor, animation, and present Kineticharts, an animation design scheme for creating charts that express ﬁve positive affects: joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement. These ﬁve affects were found to be frequently communicated through animation in data stories. Regarding each affect, we designed varied kinetic motions represented by bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, resulting in 60 animated charts for the ﬁve affects. We designed Kineticharts by ﬁrst conducting a need-ﬁnding study with professional practitioners from data journalism and then analyzing a corpus of affective motion graphics to identify salient kinetic patterns. We evaluated Kineticharts through two user studies."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"The results suggest that Kineticharts can accurately convey affects, and improve the expressiveness of data stories, as well as enhance user engagement without hindering data comprehension compared to the animation design from DataClips, an authoring tool for data videos. Index Terms—Animation, Storytelling, Affective Design 1I NTRODUCTION Recent years have witnessed an increasing prevalence of data-driven storytelling in various ﬁelds [73, 78]. To make data stories attractive,compelling, and attention-grabbing, designers and storytellers often seek to improve the affective expressiveness of their stories, namely to elicit emotions, moods, or feelings from viewers [4,6,43]. For example, a data story for entertainment should look fun [96] while a story that calls for attention should make people feel surprised [59]. Increasingly, researchers from the visualization community agree that it is criticalto incorporate affective design into the creation of data stories [4, 6, 76, 94]. Among numerous design factors, animation is one important and frequently-used technique to deliver affective information, as ithelps enrich the meaning of motion, create a mood for storytelling, and make people more likely to become immersed in the storytelling process [52, 81, 84]. For example, the Fallen of World War II [32], an award-winning data video that examines the victims of the war, uses animations such as zoom and pause to create suspense about the death toll and trigger surprise from a wide audience. However, in the visualization community, prior work concerning animation has largely focused on how animation facilitates data transi- tion and data analysis [19, 36, 74], while recently, the role of animation as a powerful storytelling device has been highlighted."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"Nevertheless, as yet no systematic work has been done to investigate how to design affective animation for the charts in data stories. We still lack knowledge on which affects commonly found in data stories can be conveyed by animation, how to design animation for charts to appropriately express these affects, and what beneﬁts such design can deliver. To address these research questions, ﬁrst, we conducted a prelimi- nary study with nine experts from data journalism and 25 professional • XingyuLan,YangShi,YanqiuWu,XiaohanJiao,andNanCaoarewith IntelligentBigDataVisualizationLabatTongjiUniversity.

As a result, we identiﬁed ﬁve affects, all of positive valence, that are likely to be communicated through animation in data stories: joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement. Then, we collected a corpus of affective motion graphics using the search key- words of the identiﬁed affects and analyzed the animations by coding their design patterns. Based on these patterns, we designed Kineticharts, an animation design scheme for creating affective charts."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"The results of the experiment indicated that Kineticharts can signiﬁcantly improve story expressiveness and af- fective engagement without hindering data comprehension compared to common animation techniques found in data videos authoring tools [3]. 2R ELATED WORK In this section, we look back to previous research on affective design, designing data stories, and animation in visualization. 2.1 Affective Design Affective design is a user-centered design paradigm that aims to elicit users’ affective responses, such as emotions, moods, and feel- ings [44, 47]. Since human beings are affective creatures [51],affect-inducing design is often felt more attractive, engaging, andinteresting [67, 91]. There is also evidence that eliciting affectscan enhance learning, improve memorability, and facilitate decision-making [27, 41, 56]. To leverage such beneﬁts, researchers from do- mains such as HCI [52,81] and graphic design [91] have been exploring how to design for affective responses."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"E8 stated that “affective animation is like giving data a persona, mak- ing the visualization more human-like.” E3 said, “I think affective animation is a good way to make the story more novel and interesting.” Pitfalls While the experts all agreed on the beneﬁts of applying affective animation into data stories, some also expressed their concerns, which we summarized as follows: Animation is good at expressing limited types of affect. E1, E3, and E5 suggested that some affects can be more easily achieved by animation while some affects may ask for more complex design tech- niques. For example, E1 said, “I often want to elicit empathy from the audience, and I don’t think animation alone can make it; photographs and narratives should also be integrated to do this job.” E5 said that “designers need to decide which design techniques are most suitable for the story and prevent the wrong use of animation, which requires lots of experience. For example, to express negative feelings, I may rely more on design factors such as music and color.” Inappropriate animation design may distract users."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"We answer this question by ﬁrst conducting a literature review and then sending a questionnaire to professional practitioners of data stories.3.2.1 Study Material We ﬁrst conducted a literature review of previous studies. Since re- search about affective design is sparse in the visualization community, we expanded our survey to literature about visual storytelling. Specif- ically, we surveyed literature across various domains, and identiﬁed papers that study affects elicited by visual storytelling by conducting lit- erature surveys, case studies, or user studies. These include works in vi-sualization [4,6,14,43,94], human-computer interaction [52,53,72,92], multimedia [31, 54, 77, 91, 93, 98], advertising [8, 9, 25, 26], and com- munications studies [22, 24, 50, 66, 82]."

The ﬁve affects we chose at last are highlighted. 3.2.2 Procedure and Results Based on the identiﬁed affects, we conducted a survey with 25 partici- pants (including the nine experts we interviewed). The 25 participants (17 female, aged from 23 to 34) were recruited via an open call on social media. In the open call, we mentioned that we were looking for people who have experience with data stories. We also sent the message to several chat groups concerning data journalism and data visualization. Among the 25 participants, seven are data journalists, three are data editors, two are scriptwriters, and 13 are visual design- ers or animators. All participants said that they have experience with data stories (1-3 years: 64%, 3-5 years: 28%, above 5 years: 8%). The participants were presented with an online questionnaire and were asked to: (i) provide their demographic information, (ii) choose and rank the affects (from the 13 affects) that are desired by data stories and explain reasons, and (iii) choose and rank the affects (from the 13 affects) that can be conveyed by animation in data stories and explain reasons. For question (iii), we also encouraged the participants to list speciﬁc story topics that tend to express the highly ranked affects. The ranking task allowed the participants to choose and rank any number ofaffects as they wanted. We also told the participants at the beginning of the questionnaire that if they could not ﬁnd any proper choices, they could choose none of them."

For example, empathy, seriousness, and contentment, whiledesired by data stories, were thought not likely to be communicated through animation alone (e.g., “seriousness is a common goal of news reports but I don’t think it is very related to animation.”, “According to my experience, color and texts are good means of evoking empathy. Perhaps animation is also useful, but I think it should be used in com- pany with color or texts. ” ). Similarly, affects rated higher in terms of the possibility to be conveyed by animation may be rated lower in termsof the desirability for data stories (e.g., sadness, fear, anger). Therefore, we examined the intersection of the two rankings, removed the affects that ranked low in any of the two rankings, and identiﬁed ﬁve affects that are both desired by data stories and are likely to be conveyed by animation: joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement (we discuss why they are all positive affects in Section 8). These ﬁve affects serve as our design goal in the next section. 4D ESIGNING AFFECTIVE ANIMATION In this section, we present Kinecticharts, an animation design scheme for creating charts that express joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement. 4.1 Methods First, we proposed four principles to guide the design of Kinecticharts from a high level. Then, we collected a corpus of affective motioninto affective design. For example, affects can be characterized as discrete categories [63] or in a circumplex or the PAD space [62, 75]."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data storytelling,"In the visualization community, although animation is a common device for data storytelling [2, 83], we still lack knowledge on how to design affective animation for the charts in data stories. Thus, this work introduces the idea of affective animation into data stories and explores how to design animated charts to convey ﬁve positive affects. 2.2 Designing Data Stories Data stories combine visualization with storytelling techniques to fa- cilitate data presentation and communicate the insights provided by the data [45]. In recent years, more and more researchers have sought to understand how to design expressive data stories. Typical topicsinclude the structure of data narratives [1, 39, 78], visual embellish-ment [7, 11, 13], and layout [4, 16]. In addition, more measurements have been introduced to aid data story design from various perspectives, such as people’s ﬁrst impressions [35], memory [7, 13], and recall [12]. Recently, affective feeling, as another important aspect of user experi- ence with data stories, has been highlighted [43, 47, 76, 94] and used to evaluate data stories [2, 95]. For example, Kennedy and Hill [43] con- ducted an empirical study with 46 participants and found that emotion is an important constituent of everyday engagement with data. However, while the importance of affects has been addressed, how to design affect-inducing data stories is still under-explored. Some studies have shed light on several design factors that may lead to affectivefeelings. For example, Bartram et al. [6] proved that color can leadto different affects in visualizations. Boy et al. [14] found that using human-like pictograms does not help elicit empathy when presenting human rights data."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"Thus, this work takes the ﬁrst steps to explore how to design animated charts to express ﬁve positive affects in data stories. 2.3 Animation in Visualization Animation, as the illusion of motion, plays various roles in design practice [21]. In the visualization community, animation is a common technique to display the change in data mappings during data analy- sis [36, 74]. In this context, animation has been viewed as a double- edged sword. While some researchers found that animation may hinder accurate perception [74, 87], some has focused on how to utilize the beneﬁts brought by animation [19,20,29]."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"In the context of storytelling, animation is more frequently viewed as a useful technique to support the narratives of data stories and keep users engaged [2, 61, 78, 83].One important reason is that animation is good at encoding affectivemessages and triggering affective feelings [17, 21, 23]. For example, Bach et al. [4] observed that storytellers often use animation to express emotion in data stories. Shi et al. [80] identiﬁed a set of storytelling- related animation techniques in data videos. Some of them are designed to create suspense or surprise. Fisher [29] also mentioned that anima- tion can be designed to express affects such as happiness and sadness."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"While the above work has suggested animation’s great potential to elicit affects in data stories, how to design affect-inducing animatedcharts remains under-explored. Therefore, we think that exploring the affective role of animation in data stories can be an important and timely complement to previous work. 3N EED-FINDING STUDY To start with, we conducted a need-ﬁnding study with professional practitioners experienced in data stories. The study contains two parts: First, we conducted in-depth interviews with nine domain experts to understand the motivations and pitfalls of designing affective animation for visualizations. Second, we sent a questionnaire to 25 professional practitioners of data stories to identify which affects in data stories are more likely to be conveyed by animation.3.1 Expert Interviews By interviewing domain experts, we attempted to clarify two issues: (i) why affective animation design is needed by data stories and (ii) the pitfalls of designing affective animation for visualizations. 3.1.1 Procedure We invited nine domain experts via social media platforms, including two data journalists (E1, E2 with three years experience writing data stories), one editor who is in charge of a data journalism channel (E3 with four years experience editing data stories), one scriptwriter of data videos (E4 with three years experience with data videos), three anima- tors (E5, E6, E7 with six years, three years, and two years experience animating data videos), and two web designers (E8 and E9 with three years and four years experience designing interactive visualizations). To start with, we introduced the key concepts (e.g., affective design, animation) in our research to the participants and asked for their con- sent to voice recording. Then, we interviewed the participants with a set of prepared questions, including “Do you think eliciting readers’ affects is important for data stories?”, “How would you design a visual- ization if you wanted to elicit affects?”, “Do you think animation is a viable means of eliciting affects?”, “If you wanted to design an affec- tive animation for visualizations, what would you do? Any examples? (for designers)”, “Did you meet any problems or challenges?”. The questions were crafted by the lead author who was a data journalist and experienced in data storytelling. We also referred to the generalguidelines for interviews [33] (e.g., easy question ﬁrst) to reﬁne the questions. During the interview process, we asked follow-up questions if we found that the participants’ answers were unclear or if we wanted to dig a little deeper. Each interview lasted approximately 30 minutes. 3.1.2 Analysis and Results After the voice recordings were transcribed, we analyzed the transcrip- tions following a thematic analysis process [15]."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"Our ﬁndings are as follows: Motivations All participants agreed that affective design is impor- tant for data stories, since many data stories are intentionally created to communicate affective messages such as surprising data facts to the audience. Besides, the participants thought that eliciting affects can engage the audience, make the story more memorable, and lead to more clicks and sharing. Common means of designing affective visualization include manipulating static features (e.g., color and embellishment)as well as dynamic features (e.g., animation). The participants also acknowledged that animation is an important component of affective design, especially for storytelling genres such as data videos and inter- active web pages."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"For example, E8 said that “human eyes always like tracing moving objects; animated objects can quickly grab your attention among multiple visual elements, so I will give animation a high priority when doing affective design.” Affective animation creates a tone for data stories and enhances the presentation of data. Most participants (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7, E9) mentioned that affective animation helps create an atmosphere for data stories and makes viewers feel more immersed in the content.

A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"E8 stated that “affective animation is like giving data a persona, mak- ing the visualization more human-like.” E3 said, “I think affective animation is a good way to make the story more novel and interesting.” Pitfalls While the experts all agreed on the beneﬁts of applying affective animation into data stories, some also expressed their concerns, which we summarized as follows: Animation is good at expressing limited types of affect. E1, E3, and E5 suggested that some affects can be more easily achieved by animation while some affects may ask for more complex design tech- niques. For example, E1 said, “I often want to elicit empathy from the audience, and I don’t think animation alone can make it; photographs and narratives should also be integrated to do this job.” E5 said that “designers need to decide which design techniques are most suitable for the story and prevent the wrong use of animation, which requires lots of experience. For example, to express negative feelings, I may rely more on design factors such as music and color.” Inappropriate animation design may distract users."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data stories,"We answer this question by ﬁrst conducting a literature review and then sending a questionnaire to professional practitioners of data stories.3.2.1 Study Material We ﬁrst conducted a literature review of previous studies. Since re- search about affective design is sparse in the visualization community, we expanded our survey to literature about visual storytelling. Specif- ically, we surveyed literature across various domains, and identiﬁed papers that study affects elicited by visual storytelling by conducting lit- erature surveys, case studies, or user studies. These include works in vi-sualization [4,6,14,43,94], human-computer interaction [52,53,72,92], multimedia [31, 54, 77, 91, 93, 98], advertising [8, 9, 25, 26], and com- munications studies [22, 24, 50, 66, 82]."

The ﬁve affects we chose at last are highlighted. 3.2.2 Procedure and Results Based on the identiﬁed affects, we conducted a survey with 25 partici- pants (including the nine experts we interviewed). The 25 participants (17 female, aged from 23 to 34) were recruited via an open call on social media. In the open call, we mentioned that we were looking for people who have experience with data stories. We also sent the message to several chat groups concerning data journalism and data visualization. Among the 25 participants, seven are data journalists, three are data editors, two are scriptwriters, and 13 are visual design- ers or animators. All participants said that they have experience with data stories (1-3 years: 64%, 3-5 years: 28%, above 5 years: 8%). The participants were presented with an online questionnaire and were asked to: (i) provide their demographic information, (ii) choose and rank the affects (from the 13 affects) that are desired by data stories and explain reasons, and (iii) choose and rank the affects (from the 13 affects) that can be conveyed by animation in data stories and explain reasons. For question (iii), we also encouraged the participants to list speciﬁc story topics that tend to express the highly ranked affects. The ranking task allowed the participants to choose and rank any number ofaffects as they wanted. We also told the participants at the beginning of the questionnaire that if they could not ﬁnd any proper choices, they could choose none of them."

Our reasons are as follows. First, the authors of Dataclips had analyzed a corpus of data videos and identiﬁed the most frequently applied animations in data videos. In other words, the anima- tions in Dataclips are common in the wild."

The story pieces were adapted from published data stories by the ﬁrst author and two experts we interviewed in Section 3. We then conducted a pilot study with 8 participants to ensure that the data story pieces had similar complexity and would not overburden the partici- pants. Speciﬁcally, we assessed the complexity of the stories by asking the participants “did you ﬁnd that a story is more complex than others?” and “do you think that the amount of information is comfortable for you to read?” in a post-study interview. We originally designed stories with nine data points, seven data points, and ﬁve data points and found that the participants were most comfortable with the ﬁve-data-point version as it cost them the least reading and interpreting texts. At last, all the charts comprised ﬁve data points."

Their ages ranged from 18 to 76 (M = 36.67, SD= 13.73) and their educational level varied (Less than a high school diploma: 0.9%, High school or equivalent: 30.1%, Bachelor’s or equivalent: 48.4%, Master’s or equivalent: 19.8%, Doctoral or equivalent: 0.4%, Others: 0.4%). We paid the participants $9 per hour, and the average time for one participant to complete the study was 45.20 minutes. 6.1.3 Measurements To measure data comprehension, we referred to the method of Bate- man et al. [7] who broke down data comprehension into four speciﬁc aspects, including (1) the subject (“what is the subject of the chart?”), (2) values (“what are the displayed categories and values?”), (3) trend (“what is the basic trend of the graph? (only for line charts)”), and (4) value message (“what message do you think the storyteller wants to communicate?”)."

We did not ﬁnd standard metrics for measuring the affec- tive expressiveness of storytelling. We used four indicators, including the creation of the story tone, the delivery of affective messages, the relatability of the story content, and the overall level of the story’s affective expressiveness. The indicators were partly inspired by litera- ture [10, 71] that has suggested some important aspects of storytellingchart components twist their “bodies” when entering the scene."

Our reasons are as follows. First, the authors of Dataclips had analyzed a corpus of data videos and identiﬁed the most frequently applied animations in data videos. In other words, the anima- tions in Dataclips are common in the wild."
A18,Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,1,1,data story,"In total, we created 30 data story pieces (i.e., 5 affects ×2 topics ×3 charts). The story pieces were adapted from published data stories by the ﬁrst author and two experts we interviewed in Section 3. We then conducted a pilot study with 8 participants to ensure that the data story pieces had similar complexity and would not overburden the partici- pants. Speciﬁcally, we assessed the complexity of the stories by asking the participants “did you ﬁnd that a story is more complex than others?” and “do you think that the amount of information is comfortable for you to read?” in a post-study interview. We originally designed stories with nine data points, seven data points, and ﬁve data points and found that the participants were most comfortable with the ﬁve-data-point version as it cost them the least reading and interpreting texts. At last, all the charts comprised ﬁve data points."

Their ages ranged from 18 to 76 (M = 36.67, SD= 13.73) and their educational level varied (Less than a high school diploma: 0.9%, High school or equivalent: 30.1%, Bachelor’s or equivalent: 48.4%, Master’s or equivalent: 19.8%, Doctoral or equivalent: 0.4%, Others: 0.4%). We paid the participants $9 per hour, and the average time for one participant to complete the study was 45.20 minutes. 6.1.3 Measurements To measure data comprehension, we referred to the method of Bate- man et al.

We used four indicators, including the creation of the story tone, the delivery of affective messages, the relatability of the story content, and the overall level of the story’s affective expressiveness. The indicators were partly inspired by litera- ture [10, 71] that has suggested some important aspects of storytellingchart components twist their “bodies” when entering the scene."

Unlike analytical tools that focus on rapidlygenerating data visualizations, tools that help create such data stories allow users to add textual descriptions and annotations, as well as to customize visual marks and layouts [16, 40, 59, 65]. Some of these tools focus on the production of a single narrative visualization [2, 25, 26, 39, 49, 50, 52, 66] or addition of direct annotations [48]. Others support creating a complete narrative with a sequence of visualizations and textual explanations [4, 13, 19, 24, 42, 51]. Existing systems also explore novel forms of data stories including videos [4], comics [24], and slideshows [13, 19, 51]. However, existing storytelling tools do not support the interactive synthesis of text and visualization. In these tools, textual parts aremostly considered passive supportive elements—semantically con- nected yet separated from the associated visualizations. Therefore, prac- titioners rely on programming frameworks (e.g., D3 [12] or Idyll [15]) in order to create interactive references between the two (see an inter- active article about Boston’s subway system1)."

As a result, we observed that it often does not link to the chart expected by the user, especially when the chartsshare the same underlying dataset. Resolving such ambiguity can bechallenging without the user’s explicit input. A potential resolution method would consider the user’s current cursor or the distance from the text to the chart."

Like its namesake, Hans Rosling (1948–2017), a professor of public health and a spellbinding public speaker , Roslingiﬁer turns a sequence of entities changing over time—such as countries and continents with their demographic data—into an engaging narrative elling the story of the data. This data-driven storytelling method with an in-person presenter is a new genre of storytelling technique and has never been studied before. In this article, we aim to deﬁne a design space for this new genre—data presentation—and provide a semi-automated authoring tool for helping presenters create quality presentations. From an in-depth analysis of video clips of presentations using interactive visualizations, we derive three speciﬁc techniques to achieve this: natural language narratives, visual effects that highlight events, and temporal branching that changes playback time of the animation. Our implementation of the Roslingiﬁer method is capable of identifying and clustering signiﬁcant movements, automatically generating visual highlighting and a narrative for playback, and enabling the user to customize."

Data comics [10], [11] combines aspects of comics and narrative visualization to deliver fun and engaging stories.

The use of data visualization as the primary driver by an in-person speaker, making it a different cate- gory from data videos [8], [12]. Data presentations are widely used in diverse ﬁelds including news media and data-driven organizations in the form of weather [W1], [W2] or market reports [M1], [M2], live coverage of the referendum result [N1], or Rosling’s TED talks [R1]–[R10] (see Section 3.2). To support these new storytelling methods, we imple- ment a complete pipeline system combining visual analysis, story creation, and presentation."
A21,Roslingifier: Semi-Automated Storytelling for Animated Scatterplots,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"The contributions of our paper include: (1) a formative study to deﬁne a design space of storytelling methods employed by effective public speakers during data presen- tations; (2) the implementation of the R OSLINGIFIER system, which includes automated methods and graphical interfa- ces for authoring data presentations from continuous time- series data; (3) comprehensive user studies evaluating the system from both authoring and viewing perspectives; and (4) a discussion of lessons learned and design implications for future research. 2B ACKGROUND Here we review the literature on narrative visualization, including speciﬁc methods, techniques, and authoring systems. 2.1 Data-Driven Storytelling Techniques There have been many research efforts to survey and catego- rize existing data-driven storytelling techniques. Segel and Heer review 58 visualizations for storytelling and provide a design space of narrative visualization that enables both explor- ative and communicative aspects of visualization. Their design space consists of three dimensions: (i) genres, (ii) visual narratives, and (iii) narrative structures. Hullman and Diakopoulos [7] distinguish visual rhetorics by reviewing 51narrative visualizations and discuss the effect of applying the rhetorics to four editorial layers in narrative visuali- zation, which are data, visual representation, annotations, and interactivity, respectively. Hullman et al. [13] analyzes narrative sequencing of 45 narrative visualizations, arguing that narrative sequencing is of important factor that affects comprehension and memory. Stolper et al. [14] provide a sur- vey of 45 recent narrative visualization examples. There are many factors that shape the visual narrative ﬂow with on combinations of user input methods, story components, and visual feedback [15]. McKenna et al. [15] investigate how different visual narrative ﬂo ws impact viewers’ reading experience. New storytelling and communication media are begin- ning to be used for narrative visualization. Data videos are motion graphics that combine pictographic representations and animation techniques into narrative visualization [8]. Amini et al. [12] systematically analyze what elements (e.g., narrative structures) constitute data videos from 50 data videos and discuss data video production approaches, such as strategies for engaging viewers. They later proposed DataClips [9], which is an interactive system for authoring data videos incorporating visualization. Data comics is an emerging new communication medium and a genre of sto- rytelling [8] that combines aspects of comics and narrative visualization [11], [16], [17]."
A21,Roslingifier: Semi-Automated Storytelling for Animated Scatterplots,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"The genre of data-driven storytelling techniques most similar to data presentations is what Amini et al. calldata vid- eos[12], or what Segel and Heer recognized as the ﬁlm/video/ animation genre of their seven genres of narrative visualiza- tion [8]. We note that while data presentations are similar to data videos, and may in fact often be recorded on video (which is how many of us get to see them), the signiﬁcant difference is the presence of an in-person speaker—rather than a disembodied narrator—using the visualization as a visual aid to convey a message. Proliﬁc examples of data presentations include Rosling’s talk on common misconceptions around the so-called “Third World” [1], as well as Al Gore’s presentation on CO2 emissions in the movie An Inconvenient Truth . Contrast the above data presentations with videos where either subtitles or a disembodied voice—Hans Rosling has in fact recorded a few of these—narrates animated visual- izations, such as in the online documentary The Fallen of World War II [19] or in A Day in the Life of Mister O. [20], an abstract short ﬁlm about humanity’s environmental impact on the world’s oceans."
A21,Roslingifier: Semi-Automated Storytelling for Animated Scatterplots,1,1,narrative visualization,"As such, there have been many visual tools that allow efﬁcient design of stories and narrative visualization. We see three types of approaches in the existing tool for authoring stories. The ﬁrst type of authoring tools are those that help users to easily or automatically add visual components of storytelling to existing visualizations, such as labels [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. For example, Ren et al. [25] derive design space of annotations (e.g., shapes) and present ChartAccent, which allows interactive annotations on visualization."

Interaction can also be combined with the narrative device, breaking the fourth wall (BTFW), to build a deeper connection between readers and data stories. BTFW interaction directly addresses readers by requiring their input. Such user input is then integrated into the narrative or visuals of data stories to encourage readers to inspect the stories more closely. In this work, we explore the design patterns of BTFW interaction commonly used in data stories. Six design patterns were identified through the analysis of 58 high-quality data stories collected from a range of online sources. Specifically, the data stories were categorized using a coding framework, including the input of BTFW interaction provided by readers and the output of BTFW interaction generated by data stories to respond to the input. To explore the benefits as well as concerns of using BTFW interaction, we conducted a three-session user study including the reading, interview, and recall sessions. The results of our user study suggested that BTFW interaction has a positive impact on self-story connection, user engagement, and information recall. We also discussed design implications to address the possible negative effects on the interactivity-comprehensibility balance, information privacy, and the learning curve of interaction brought by BTFW interaction."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Index Terms—Interaction, data-driven storytelling, narrative devices 1I NTRODUCTION Data stories, as a communication medium, are increasingly integrating interaction to support exploring their essential elements: data, narrative, and visuals [30, 45, 67]. Various interaction techniques such as details- on-demand and hover highlighting [63] are leveraged by these data stories to improve the reading experience and facilitate data understand- ing. Interestingly, recent years have witnessed an emerging interactive approach to data stories, which requires input from readers. Notable examples include the Bloomberg article called “Find out if your job will be automated ” [11] which allows a reader to search by his or her occupation and The New York Times article called “You draw it ” [70] which enables a reader to draw his or her guess of a trendline on a chart. A key design idea in these stories is combining interaction with the narrative device, breaking the fourth wall (BTFW). Originating from theater, the fourth wall is an imaginary wall that separates actors from the audience, while the other three walls frame the scene [6]."

[49] compared data stories to be displayed with a step- and scroll-based navigation but did not find a significant difference in engagement between the two types of navigation input. Feng et al.

A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"However,the role of interaction that helps build reader connections to data stories has been largely overlooked. To fill the gap, our work explores BTFW interaction in data stories and its common design patterns by following three complementary methods. First, we conducted a series of interviews with five data story experts to understand the benefits as well as challenges of applyingBTFW interaction to data stories. Second, we collected a corpus of 58 data stories that leverage BTFW interaction, from a range of online sources. We then identified six design patterns of BTFW interaction, which were derived by coding i) the input of BTFW interaction provided by readers and ii) the output of BTFW interaction generated by datastories that responds to such input. Third, we conducted a user study with 109 participants to link user attitudes to those of the storytellers in the expert interviews. Qualitative feedback from the user study sug- gested that BTFW interaction has the potential to help build self-story connection, augment user engagement, and improve information recall."

To better understand the role of interac- tion in visualization, prior research has categorized interactions from different perspectives [34, 62, 77]. For example, Yi et al. [77] proposed seven general categories of interaction which were organized around users’ intent when interacting with a visualization system, namely, Select, Explore, Reconfigure, Encode, Abstract/Elaborate, Filter, and Connect. Sedig and Parsons [62] synthesized 32 interactive actions in a framework of complex cognitive activities, and these actions were divided into two categories, including Unipolar and Bipolar."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Specifically, our work focuses on interaction for data-driven storytelling rather than visual analysis. 2.2 Interaction for Data-driven Storytelling Data-driven storytelling is an increasingly adopted method that uses visualization as a storytelling form to communicate data insights [45]. Early in the development of data stories, researchers have noticed the important role that interaction can play. When Segel and Heer [63] first proposed the concept of narrative visualization, interactivity was set as a fundamental dimension of the design space. This dimension includes seven common interactions such as hover, filtering, and nav- igation. Their design space of narrative visualization has also been reflected and extended in recent years due to the rapid development of interaction. For example, Stolper et al. [66] identified and described storytelling techniques that were used in newly emerged data stories. These techniques were classified into four categories, including commu- nicating narrative and explaining data, linking separated story elements, enhancing structure and navigation, and providing controlled explo-ration. Wang et al. [73] developed a design space of interaction fordata comics, which describes interactions by a trigger, results in vi- sual effects that can affect panel content, and/or panel layout around a particular communication goal. Interaction can also provide direct benefits to story readers, includ- ing deepening the comprehension and recall of information, eliciting deeper reflection, and augmenting levels of engagement [40, 58, 78].Specifically, Hohman et al. [36] identified five unique affordancesof interactive articles, namely, connecting people and data, making systems playful, prompting self-reflection, personalizing reading, and reducing cognitive load."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Compared with interaction for data visualization, interaction for data-driven storytelling is somehow in its infancy. To the best of our knowledge, no works have systematicallyexplored the design space of interaction for data-driven storytelling. Also, the role and effects of many widely used interaction techniques have not been fully understood yet. Thus, our work attempts to under- stand the interaction that is used to break the fourth wall of data stories and explore the possible benefits of such interaction. 2.3 Breaking the Forth Wall The fourth wall is a notion first proposed by Denis Diderot in the 18th- century theater [9, 17, 26]. In theatrical performance, the fourth wall is an imagined, invisible wall between actors and the audience. While the audience can see through this wall, the actors cannot, thus, are not aware of the existence of the audience [72, 75]. Nowadays, the fourth wall has become a well-established convention followed by various mediums, such as theater, cinema, and literature."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"In one case, Bach et al. [6] suggested that BTFW can be used as a narrative design pattern to frame data-driven storytelling and trigger affective responses. Instead, we investigated how to achieve BTFW in data stories by directly “speaking” to readers through interac- tion. To the best of our knowledge, our work systematically explores the combination of BTFW interaction and data-driven storytelling for the first time. 3P RELIMINARY STUDY To understand how BTFW interaction has been leveraged by storytellers in practice, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews withfive domain experts. Our goal is to gain insights into the following issues: (i) the motivations for applying BTFW interaction to data stories and (ii) the potential challenges arising from using BTFW interaction. 3.1 Interviews with Domain Experts We recruited domain experts by publishing an invitation poster on social media platforms and word of mouth. To understand perspectives from both academia and industry, we finally invited three data journalists E1 (six years’ experience), E2 (six years’ experience), E3 (seven years’ experience) from news agencies, and two data visualization researchers E4 (seven years’ experience), E5 (six years’ experience) from research labs. We introduced the concept of BTFW interaction to the experts and all of them reported that they are experienced in applying it todesigning data stories. In their past practice, the experts sometimes collected basic personal information for their data stories such as ageand residential address. The experts considered the collection of data as a means of helping create personalized stories. They decided to use such interaction because, for certain topics, the content of the story can vary from person to person, and a generalized description will reduce the degree of personalization. “For stories that focus on personal health, I need the user’s information to rate and advise him on his health status” (E2). In addition, they applied such interaction to show the gap between facts and public perception. “It reminds readers that their perception of a good body may be opposed to the standard ” (E3)."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"In the first session, we introduced our research topic and the concept of BTFW interaction to the interviewees, We also showed them examples of data stories that use BTFW interaction and encouraged them toshare such data stories created by their own. After the intervieweesindicated that they were clear about the topic and the concept, we started the second session. We asked them a set of interview questions such as “what type of BTFW interaction did you use in your datastory?”, “why did you add BTFW interaction to your data story?”,and “what challenges did you face when using BTFW interaction?”.Each interview lasted about 40 minutes and was audio-recorded for subsequent analysis. 3.2 Analysis and Findings To analyze the qualitative data collected from the interviews, we tran- scribed the audio recordings and then coded the data based on our two research questions following the thematic analysis process [15].Specifically, two researchers first independently read through all thetranscriptions and highlighted the comments related to the questions.

A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"Three themes emerged as possible benefits of apply- ing BTFW interaction to data stories. Build a self-story connection. All of the participants mentioned that applying BTFW interaction is an effective method to build a connection between a reader and a data story. This benefit arises because BTFW interaction offers a way to “put yourself in the story”. For example, E3 said that “when discussing serious topics such as well-being and environment, it can be difficult for readers to relate themselves to the topics. However, with this type of interaction, readers’ data can be integrated into the narrative and they’ll feel more connected to the stories”."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data story,"E4 complemented that “using this interaction feels like I’m creating my own data story”. Augment user engagement. Another theme mentioned by all of the participants is that BTFW interaction serves as a storytelling device for attracting attention and augmenting engagement. Both E2 and E5 mentioned that “the inclusion of such interaction can arouse readers’ interest, elicit their emotions, trigger their desire to share and discuss, and even induce their willingness to act.”."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"Challenges Three themes emerged as the challenges of applying BTFW interaction to data stories. Information privacy concerns. Four participants (E1, E2, E3, E4) mentioned that readers’ concerns about personal privacy may reduce their willingness to use BTFW interaction. E2 commented that “typing in personal data feels like self-disclosure for readers, and they are likely to be concerned about whether this action will lead to any additional consequences beyond contributing to story reading”."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"Three participants (E1, E2, E5) mentioned that using BTFW interaction may disrupt the balance between the interactivity and comprehensibility of data stories: “readers may not always have a strong desire to explore and interpret on their own, especially for simple topics. They may prefer to read concise and ‘easy to digest’ stories; unnecessary interactions can be a barrier to effective reading”(E2), “the key task in crafting a data story is conveying its core idea determined by its author . However , if a reader is immersed in the world of self that was found in the story, the author’s core idea may be ignored ”(E5). The learning curve of interaction Four experts (E2, E3, E4, E5) noted that readers may be intimidated by the steep learning curve of interaction. “The mechanisms of this interaction can be complex some-times, and if readers have difficulty figuring it out in a short time they will simply skip it. It’s even more challenging when reading on mo-bile devices becomes more prevalent ”, said E5."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"E3 added that “when applying such interactions to my stories, I will try to mini- mize the learning cost for readers by giving them clear guidelines or deconstructing the interaction into multiple sub-steps”. 4C ODING FRAMEWORK AND DESIGN PATTERNS Interaction can be used to break the fourth wall of data stories by directly addressing readers and requiring their input concerning them- selves. To explore BTFW interaction, we first collected and analyzed a corpus of 58 data stories. Then, we derived a set of design patterns of BTFW interaction from the coding of our corpus. 4.1 Methodology We analyzed BTFW interaction in a two-step methodology. First, we collected a corpus of data stories that use BTFW interaction. Then, we constructed a coding framework that integrates interdisciplinary knowledge to identify BTFW interaction patterns.4.1.1 Data Collection To collect a corpus of high-quality data stories leveraging BTFW in- teraction, we started with the data story corpora generated by previous studies [36, 43, 49, 63, 66, 67]. After merging these corpora and remov- ing duplicates, we obtained 358 data stories and successfully retrieved 250 of them from the internet. These data stories were collected from well-known sources (e.g., New York Times, Washington Post), rec- ommended by domain experts (e.g., experienced data journalists and visualization designers), or popular among readers (e.g., winners of the Sigma Awards, opinionated lists of best visualizations). Next, we filtered out 160 data stories that are non-interactive, which use only scrolling and stepping for navigation [49]. Following the methodology by [2, 44, 64], we then searched for additional samples by survey- ing news agencies famous for data stories (e.g., The New York Times, FiveThirtyEight) and authoritative data visualization awards (e.g., Infor- mation is Beautiful, The Sigma Award). For example, we first located related columns on these platforms such as The Upshot in The New York Times and then searched for news articles with keywords such as “interactive article” and “interactive infographic”. After that, we com- plemented 176 additional interactive data stories. Finally, we checked Fig. 1. Frequency of the 58 data stories about (a) year and (b) subject.

Specifically, we set three criteria to man- date that the stories (i) present arguments or facts supported by data, (ii) include at least one data visualization, and (iii) address readers directly and require their input. As a result, we identified 58 out of 266 data stories to constitute our final corpus. The 58 data stories were produced from 2013 to 2021 and their subjects range from sociology to space science, as shown in Fig. 1. 4.1.2 Coding Framework After data collection, we coded the corpus from two aspects using the method of close reading [20]: (i) what is the input of BTFW interaction and (ii) what is the output of BTFW interaction that responds to the input. The two-dimensional framework mirrors a key concept of inter- action in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) [37] and visualization literature [29], which considers interaction as dialogue. By using the metaphor of dialogue, interaction is viewed as a cycle of communica- tion between a user and an interactive system, in which actions from the user and reactions from the system can be both perceived [29]. Sim- ilarly, our coding framework models BTFW interaction as a dialogue between readers and interactive data stories. In such a dialogue, we considered the actions from readers as the input of BTFW interaction while the reactions from stories as the output. For (i), we analyzed the input of BTFW interaction (the actions from readers) through the lens of the data–information–knowledge–wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy [1, 60], which is a widely recognized theory that originated from the field of information management. Specifically, the hierarchy explains how the human mind moves data up to higher levels by progressive organization; first comes data, next are information and knowledge, and finally comes wisdom."

The next subsection explains these design patterns in detail and relates them back to the samples in our corpus. 4.2 Design Patterns A design pattern fills one cluster in Fig. 3 and is further defined by a name, a description, an example, and an abstract illustration, as shown in Fig. 4. In the following, we describe the identified design pattern from C1toC6(left-right, down-top in Fig. 3). Fig. 4."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data story,"Using Golden Hook, a data story is started with the Establisher based on readers’ personal data or knowledge. This design pattern can only be found at the beginning of the story and is used to help readers quickly understand the topic of a story. Much like a fish gets hooked by bait, Golden Hook attempts to captivate readers and make them want to read more. For example, at the Establisher of “Here’s every total solar eclipse happening in your lifetime “ [46], the story asks for readers’ birth year, then calculates the number of total solar eclipses in readers’ lifetime and visualizes the path of each eclipse."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"Here, we merged inputs of data and knowledge, as the data stories using these two levels of input share similar characteristics in forms and serve a specific purpose,that is, attracting readers’ attention quickly and motivating them to find explanations in the following story.

This design pattern requires readers’ personal data as a supplement to the supporting facts and then presents the data as personalized visual- ization."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data story,"Simulator uses visualization as the input interface for exploration in the Initial of a data story. Specifically, the visualiza- tion models a fact or a theory and exposes parameters that readers can manipulate to change the behavior of the simulation. By making a series of decisions, readers can learn the fact or the theory by “experiencing” it themselves. In contrast to Kaleidoscope (C2), Simulator strengthens arguments by encouraging readers to use trial and error rather thandirectly presenting the outcome to them."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data story,"Spotlight is applied at the Peak of a data story, where the major insight is shared with readers. With this pattern, the major insight is presented as a visualization, usually in a form of a map, to encourage readers to explore. Specifically, the visualization asksfor readers’ addresses and highlights the data points related to them. Compared to Kaleidoscope (C2) which uses personalized visualization, Spotlight provides an overview first and then allows readers to zoom in to obtain a closer view of interest."

Specifically, six data stories were selected from our corpus, one for each of thedesign patterns of BTFW interaction (C1-C6). We also mandatedthat all of the data stories are on pandemic-related topics to provide situations where the participants are likely to have shared knowledge orexpectations of the domain. For example, C1 asks for readers’ personal data and suggests their position in the vaccine line at the beginning of the story. C4 requires readers’ addresses to see the capacity of hospitals nearby them. C6 invites readers to guess how much prices have risen for common grocery items during the pandemic."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data story,"We were unable tofind a pandemic-related data story employing the Magic Mirror (C5)technique. As an alternative, we selected the data story, “How youwill die” [76], whose health-related topic is the most related to thepandemic in our corpus. We also included one non-interactive data story about Covid-19 (C0). Although without interactivity, it breaks the fourth wall through the narrative by addressing readers directly suchas “the risk of encountering a COVID-19-infected person at YOUR small, intimate gathering was about 82 percent ”. The seven data stories (C0-C6) constitute the stimuli for our study. 5.2 Participants To estimate the appropriate sample size, we first performed a power analysis in one-way ANOV A based on our pilot study. We achieved 0.8 power under α= 0.05 with 42 participants per condition, resulting in at least 108 participants in total. Then, we recruited 109 participants (55 females) by posting advertisements on social platforms. The par- ticipants ranged in age from 21 to 50 (M = 24.54, SD = 3.15)."

The participants also have different cultural backgrounds, including China: 84 (77.1%) and the United States: 25 (22.9%). 5.3 Task and Procedure The user study consists of three sessions: the reading session, the inter- view session, and the recall session. Before the study, we sent emails to our participants to ask about their willingness to take part in the interview session. As a result, 26 out of the 109 participants responded positively."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data story,"Then, they were presented with two interactive data stories chosen from our stimuli and the non-interactive data story (C0), one at a time. We ensured that each of C1-C6 was read by at least 36 participants. The order of the three stories was randomized to avoid confounding effects. After the participants finished reading and exploring a story, they were asked to rate it using a questionnaire that measures the design patterns from four aspects, including self-story connection, user engagement, information recall, and the balance be- tween interactivity and comprehensibility."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"When all three data stories had been read, we started the interview session. We conducted a semi- structured interview with the participants to learn about their reading experiences and the reasons for ratings. The reading and interview sessions lasted about 45 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. Two weeks after the interview session, we sent emails again to invite our participants to complete the recall session. 18 participants accepted our invitation."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"The topic of interactive data stories left a deeper impression on the participants than the non-interactive story. Most of the participants remembered the topic of C1-C6 clearly (e.g., “it’s about the cause of death in different age groups” (P19)). By contrast, 27.8% of the participants almost completely forgot C0 (e.g., “I thought I only read two stories” (P12)). For the participants who still remembered C0, they could also retell the major insight of it (e.g., “it told us small gathering is also dangerous during the pandemic” (P18))."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"However, some participants mentioned that interactive data stories were not their favorites because they some- times felt confused during interaction (e.g., “the authors do not provideguidance clear enough, I can learn nothing from the story” (P16)). This feedback is in line with our findings from the preliminary study that when inappropriately designed, interaction may hinder comprehensi- bility. In addition, the participants preferred interactive stories as the stimuli that were most relevant to themselves. The sense of relevance is mainly from the personalized narrative or visualization (e.g., “C0 is for everyone, but I feel that the comic of the vaccine line in C1 was exclusively designed for me” (P25))."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data story,"When asked about which narrative category was the most ideal one for integrating BTFW interaction, all of the three categories werementioned by the participants. 10 out of 26 participants valued aninspiring beginning most (e.g., “readers’ interest should be raisedas early as possible” (P3)), some believed BTFW interaction can bemost effective only with an adequate introduction and explanation (e.g., “ I could not fully understand the interaction without a clear context ” (P12), “I wish to interact with the climax of the story and see my personal data turns out to be” (P10)), while a few participants mentioned they hoped to experience BTFW interaction at the end of a data story (e.g., “I could make the most use of the interaction after I learned what’s going on” (P18), “if the storyteller could integrate his conclusion with the visualization result of my data produced in former stages, I could have a deeper understanding of the story” (P24)). Information Privacy and Reading Experience For most of the participants, in order to get personalized stories, the potential privacy risk of BTFW interaction was acceptable (e.g., “It sounds fair to me if I can make this story really relevant to myself by providing some less critical personal information” (P7)). On the other hand, for several participants, the willingness to interact decreased due to their concerns about information privacy. Specifically, the degree of concern is related to the type of required input."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"For example, the participants were more sensitive if data stories require data and information as input, such as age (e.g., “It feels like being asked how old I am by strangers in real life and it’s offensive to me.” (P12)) and address (e.g., “Address is the critical information for my personal security, and I do not want to take the risk of it being used for other purposes.” (P18)). However, sucha concern can be alleviated if the storytellers provide more detailedexplanations, as noted by P13, “at the beginning of the story, I was asked to fill in my age, address, and occupation without any explanation. Now I was reluctant to do so but I think more contextual information would help. When involving the input of knowledge and wisdom, theparticipants usually felt less concerned about the risk of informationprivacy."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"Specifically, the six patterns signifi- cantly improved the interactivity of data stories while did not hinder readers from understanding the stories. Overall, more than half of the participants said that the interactivity empowered by BTFW interaction helps them to learn the storytellers’ messages through the lens of their personal experience (e.g., “Based on the address I entered, the system analyzed the vaccine situation in my location from different dimensions, which gave me a better understanding of the reasons for the currentvaccine shortage” (P11)). Besides, the participants appreciated the ability to freely explore the story given by BTFW interaction, such as details on demand and zoom. In this way, they were able to learn more data insights of interest."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"Therefore, we suggest that for storytellers who attempt to design BTFW interaction for their data stories, embedding its output in the Establisher is a good choice to consider. Second, it is important to encourage various input modalities of BTFW interaction. The existing input modalities found in our corpus mainly use mouse-based interaction, including selecting, typing, slid- ing, and drawing. The input modality can have a profound impact on the reading experience."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"For example, after exploring “You draw it ” [70], one participant (P27) commented that “drawing is quite a novel interac-tion technique for data stories, and its high degree of freedom promoted me to get greater enjoyment ”. We suggest that more modalities such as speech-based interaction can be integrated into data stories. For example, through natural language interaction, readers can use flexible expressions (e.g., “Days I exercised for more than 10 minutes”) toexplore data [39]. In addition, input taking the form of speech can reflect more characteristics such as affective prosody (e.g., changes in pitch, loudness, and speech rate) in readers. Third, it is promising to explore more possibilities focusing on the blank cells in our framework that are untouched by BTFW interaction (Fig. 3)."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"In our corpus, a few interactive data stories employ such a strategy. Using fuzzy input allows readers to get personalized content while blurring their personal information. For example, in “Should prison sentences be based on crimes that haven’t been committed yet?” [7], readers can choose their age groups (e.g., <25, 25-44, and 45+) rather than inputting their exact ages. In “How many pain pills went to your pharmacy?” [31], readers can search for the name ofnearby pharmacy stations rather than the exact residential address to check the situation around."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"Second, we look at the longstanding debate on whether or not to integrate interaction into data stories [71] through the lens of BTFW. Thus, we suggested that adding an appropriate level of interactivity to data stories can improve the reading experience of data stories. For example, simple interaction techniques such as text-based search [32] and sketch-based prediction [40] provide an intuitive method to explore and explain data. Considering the upcoming trend of consuming data stories in immersive devices [55, 65], we believe that interaction will increasingly play a more important role in telling stories with data in the future. The third suggestion is to ease the learning curve of BTFW inter- action by following the widely recognized principle in HCI, affor-dance [52], which describes the relationship between what an objectlooks like and how it is used."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data stories,"In interactive data stories,managing affordances is critical, users often perceive possible actions based on the properties of interface or visualization elements. Using incorrect visual cues can hinder user experience and lead to frustration. 7.3 Limitations and Future Work There are several limitations of our work. First, the six design patterns of BTFW interaction are derived from the analysis of our corpus consist-ing of 58 data stories. As the corpus is not exhaustive nor representative of the field, the design patterns are considered as an initial step toward understanding interaction in data stories. Therefore, we encourage nar- rative visualization professionals and practitioners to expand the corpus and explore more BTFW interactions by referring to our framework.Second, when selecting stimuli for our user study, we used one spe- cific example data story from each design pattern as its representative. Thus, it is difficult to draw a generalizable conclusion from the Likert ratings of individual point examples from our corpus. Also, our study stimuli are constrained to the topics of Covid-19. Covid-19 is a global event that concerns everyone’s life."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Our future work plans to explore more possibilities of combining BTFW with data-driven storytelling. Our current work focuses on BTFW that directly addresses the audience. However, BTFW can also be achieved by having characters in a fictional story recognize their own fictitious existence. A common example is pulling back the camera in a sitcom and allowing the audience to see the walls that contain the scene."
A23,Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"In this sense, the equivalent of data-driven storytelling wouldbe a data story explaining the construction of specific visualizations (e.g., What’s so hard about histograms? [47]), which are usually hidden from readers. Another example that calls attention to the artificialityof the medium is when an actor is corpsing, that is, he or she breaks character during a scene by laughing or forgetting their lines. Similarly, such corpsing happens to data stories if glitches in visualizations are exposed to readers, due to bugs or bit rot (e.g., The bits are rotting in the state of data journalism [42]). 8C ONCLUSION This paper introduces the concept of breaking the fourth wall (BTFW) in the context of data-driven storytelling and explores different design patterns of BTFW interaction. The results of our user study suggested that BTFW interaction has the potential to enhance self-story connec- tion, user engagement, and information recall. On the other hand, BTFW interaction should be carefully used considering the balance be- tween interactivity and comprehensibility, information privacy, and the learning curve of interaction. Also, we proposed design implications to address the possibilities as well as the challenges for designing BTFW interaction."

Abstract— As an effective form of narrative visualization, visual data stories are widely used in data-driven storytelling to communicate complex insights and support data understanding. Although important, they are difficult to create, as a variety of interdisciplinary skills, such as data analysis and design, are required. In this work, we introduce Erato, a human-machine cooperative data story editing system, which allows users to generate insightful and fluent data stories together with the computer. Specifically, Erato only requires a number of keyframes provided by the user to briefly describe the topic and structure of a data story. Meanwhile, our system leverages a novel interpolation algorithm to help users insert intermediate frames between the keyframes to smooth the transition. We evaluated the effectiveness and usefulness of the Erato system via a series of evaluations including a Turing test, a controlled user study, a performance validation, and interviews with three expert users. The evaluation results showed that the proposed interpolation technique was able to generate coherent story content and help users create data stories more efficiently.

These techniques, although efficient, suffer from poor quality of the generation results and the lack of humanity, which is usually consid- ered the soul of a story. Therefore, there is a gap between manualstory authoring and automatic story generation. A tool that supports human-machine collaborative data story design and editing is desired. To fill the gap, we introduce Erato, a human-machine collaborative data story editing system, through which users can design and generate a data story together with a computer. In particular, using the system, a user only needs to concentrate on the key message by inputting a few keyframes (i.e., key data facts). The system will efficiently generatemore details of the story by interpolating between any of the twosucceeding keyframes. Users can edit both the keyframes and the generated intermediate data facts at any time."

Based on the system, a user can easily generate a data story by only editing a few keyframes and the system will fill the gap by generating a series of data facts to connect the succeeding keyframes. •Data Fact Interpolation Technique. We introduce the first inter- polation technique that is able to linearly interpolate between two data facts (usually keyframes in a data story) to generate a series of meaningfully and smoothly connected data facts. •Evaluation. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed system via an interview and case study with three expert users and also show the performance of the fact embedding model via a quantitative eval- uation and a controlled user study. A Turing test is also performed to evaluate the overall quality of the story generated based on our technique. 2R ELATED WORK Our work draws inspiration from three areas, including data-driven storytelling, automatic data visualization, and interpolation techniques in data visualization. 2.1 Data-Driven Storytelling Visual data stories refer to a set of story pieces that are visu- ally presented in a meaningful way to deliver an intended mes- sage [26, 35, 40, 49]. Studies showed that incorporating data visualiza- tions in concert with narrative could reveal information effectively [15] and enhance readers’ engagement, memory, comprehension, and com- munication [3, 13, 40]. Therefore, visual data storytelling has gained increasing popularity in many domains and evolved into an important topic in the visualization community [23]. Due to its importance, many theoretical design spaces have been introduced to help clarify the key concepts about visual narratives [31, 40,46] and provide fundamental design principles [24,25,44,45,60]. Early studies focused on high-level concepts. For example, Segel and Heer [40] classified narrative visualization into seven genres.McKenna et al. [31] identified seven key factors for building a fluent visual narrative flow. Stolper et al. [46] presented four high-level cate- gories of narrative visualization techniques. Recent studies introduce several design spaces that more elaborately provide fundamental design principles from two major aspects: the narrative structures [25, 60] and the visual representation methods [24, 44, 45], while taking communi- cation goals and design tasks into consideration. Based on these theories, techniques and authoring tools have also been proposed to help with the design and creation of visual datastories. For example, chart sequencing techniques [18, 22, 41] havebeen extensively studied for generating a data story by connecting 1https://erato.idvxlab.com/project/charts to form a meaningful sequence. Some authoring tools [6, 34, 38] aim to help users interactively create and place custom annotationsto generate a visual narrative, while others are introduced to support data videos [2], and time-oriented storytelling [4, 14]. Datatoon [19] is similar to our system in terms of leveraging interpolation techniques. However, we target at a different type of data story in this work, which requires a totally different set of techniques. Although very helpful, using the above design space or authoring tools to design and create a data story majorly rely on users to makedecisions and take actions. Sometimes, the process is cumbersome, tedious, and inefficient. To address this issue, recent studies have been focusing on automatic data story generation based on intelligent algo- rithms [8,42,43,61]. For example, Chen et al. [8] proposed a framework and automatic workflow to bridge the gap between data analysis andcommunication. AutoClips [42] optimally organizes data facts in aparallel structure to create data videos. Calliope [43] automatically generates data stories from a spreadsheet. ChartStory [61] characterizescharts by their similarity in a fixed layout to form a data story. Although efficient, these tools suffer from their generation quality and lack of user engagement. Different from the aforementioned techniques, Erato fills the gap between manually data story authoring and automatic data story gener- ation by striking a balance between machine and human involvements. It ensures the quality of stories, enhances engagement, and improves the efficiency of authoring at the same time. 2.2 Automatic Data Visualization Our work is also related to the broader area of automatic data visu- alization. As a visual data story is usually composed of individual data visualizations, the automatic extraction and visualization of data insights are essential to the efficiency of the story generation. There have been various studies of automatic data visualization over the decades, which can be largely classified into two categories:rule-based techniques and machine learning-based techniques. Rule-based techniques often derive from experimental findings and expertexperience. For example, Mackinlay’s APT [29] and Sage [36] use expressiveness and perceptual effectiveness criteria to enumerate, fil- ter, and score visualizations."

A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data story,"However, existing techniques interpolate be- tween graphic elements or visual attributes, none of them are able to directly interpolate the data to generate meaningful content used for authoring a data story. In this paper, we introduce a novel interpolation algorithm that is able to interpolate between two data facts to generate the content of story pieces directly. 3S YSTEM OVERVIEW This section introduces the design of Erato system. We first provide a formal definition of a data story and the corresponding notations that are used throughout the paper. After that, we summarize the design requirements and introduce the architectural design of the system. 3.1 Data Story In this paper, we borrow and slightly simplify the data story defini- tion introduced in [43]. In this section, we briefly introduce the key concepts and notations used in this paper as the background but leave the details in [43] for readers to reference. In particular, we define a data story as a sequence of meaningfully connected data facts that are ordered according to narrative logic. It can be formally represented as {f1,f2,⋯,fn}, where fiis a data fact, the elementary building block of the data story. Each fact provides a piece of information extracted from the data, which is formally given by a 5-tuple: fi={type ,subspace ,breakdown, measure ,f ocus} ={ti,si,bi,mi,xi} where type (denoted as ti) indicates the type of information described by the fact. Similar to Calliope, Erato also supports 10 fact types, which arevalue, difference, proportion, trend, categorization, distribution, rank, association, extreme, and outlier ;subspace (denoted as si) is given by a set of data filters, i.e., {{F 1=V1},⋯,{Fk=Vk}}, which restrict the data scope of the fact. FiandVirespectively indicate a data field and the selected field value. breakdown (denoted asbi) is a temporal or categorical data field, which divides a subspace into groups."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data story,"For example, regarding to the following fact about the Winter Olympic Games 2022 in Beijing: {“distribution”, {{Sex =“Fe- male” }},{Country },{sum(Gold Medal) },{Country=“China” }}, it indicates “the distribution (fact type) of the total number of (aggregation method) the gold medals (measure) won by females (subspace) across all the countries (breakdown) and China is the highlight (focus)”. 3.2 Design of Erato System The design of Erato system was inspired by the users’ feedback col- lected during a series of 5 workshops on data story design, which were organized either by ourselves or by our colleagues in the last year. These workshops involved a total number of 125 participants with various backgrounds, such as university students (major in design, journalism and communication, and computer science), data journalists, citizen journalists, We-Media operators, and data analysts from consul- tant/IT companies. The goal of the workshops was to teach participants how to author a data story. Each workshop has a focused topic such as “narrative structure”, “visualization and infographic design”, “data video authoring”, “data insight discovery”, and “logic transition and animation design”. The participants were asked to use design and data analysis tools such as Adobe Illustrator, After Effects, Tableau, and Calliope2(a tool developed for automatic data story generation). 2https://datacalliope.com Fig. 2. The running pipeline of the Erato system. Through these workshops, we collected a large number of valuable feedback, which eventually inspired us to design and develop the coop- erative authoring tool introduced in this paper. The feedback mainly focused on the authoring experience and resulting stories."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data story,"For example, most of the users felt using these tools to create a data story needed a lot of operations, which was quite inefficient and required much design and data analysis background. They generally liked the idea of automatic data story generation, but they felt the quality of the stories generated by Calliope was not satisfactory. They also believed Calliope limited their control and involvement. We have summarized their comments as the following design requirements: R1Incorporating Users’ Control and Involvement. To ensure the quality of a data story and incorporate users’ ideas, the system should directly let the users decide what to tell (i.e., the key message) and how to tell (i.e., the narrative structure) a data story. R2Improving the Authoring Efficiency. During the data story authoring process, the system should be able to automatically deal with the tedious and cumbersome operations such as exploring the vast data space for potential story pieces or permutably arranging the data facts into a narrative structure. R3Supporting Smart Interactive Authoring Mechanism. The system should provide a flexible and interactive mechanism that is smart enough to automatically finish some time-consuming tasks to accelerate the authoring process. In this way, users could collaborate with the system toward the same goal of creating a data story. To fulfill the requirements, we developed a cooperative data story authoring system, namely Erato, based on a novel fact interpolation technique introduced in this paper. Fig. 2 illustrates the architecture and running pipeline of the system, which consists of three major modules, including the Fact Embedder , the Interpolator , and the Story Editor . Generally, a user starts creating a data story by interactively inputting a number of data facts as key frames and arranging them into a sto-ryline via the Story Editor . In this way, the user decides what to tell (keyframes) and how to tell (narrative structure) the story (R1). After that, the keyframes in the storyline are converted into corresponding vector representations and are projected into a vector space by the Fact Embedder .The Fact Embedder is a pre-trained deep learning model that takes a fact’s specification string as the input and converts it into a vector representation to facilitate numerical calculation. Fi- nally, the Interpolator approximately interpolates between the vectors of two specified succeeding key frames to generate viable data facts by searching through the vector space (R2)."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data stories,"Training Corpus To train the model, we selected 100 high-quality data stories that were manually authored by our workshop participants based on different datasets using the Calliope system. All of thesestories consist of 5 data facts with diverse fact types. They were designed by following either the time-oriented narrative structure [25] or the parallel structure [42]. 300 fact trigrams were extracted from these stories as our training set. Each of them consisted of 3 succeeding data facts in the original story."

The above process is iteratively processed until the current best node f∗is close enough to the target node ft. Finally, the searching path in Twith the largest reward is used to make a match with the midpoints in I∗(line 11), and the set of facts that are closest to the midpoints in I∗are returned in order as the interpolation results. 5S TORY EDITOR In this section, we introduce the design of the story editor, which aims to provide an intuitive experience for users to explore, refine the interpolated facts, and eventually assemble them into a fluent story."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data story,"Once a user uploads a spreadsheet into the system, the raw data is displayed in the data story view (Fig. 6-1). Then, the user can explore the data and select the data fields and elements that he/she is interested in by setting data filters in the configuration panel under the story mode (Fig. 6-2(b)). Based on the selected data corpus, the underlying system analyzes and recommends a set of important data facts to help users quickly understand the data and inspire them to create meaningful and interesting stories (Fig. 6-2(c)), which avoids the cold start problem. To create a data story, a user first needs to specify a sequence of key facts and arrange them in the storyline view (Fig. 6-4). In particular, the user can either manually insert an empty fact anywhere in the storyline (e.g., the empty fact shown in Fig. 6-4) or simply instruct the system to interpolate between any two succeeding facts in the storyline. When a data fact fiis selected from the storyline, the fact configuration panel is displayed (Fig. 6-3), in which the user can edit the fact’s text descriptions (Fig. 6-3(b)) and its type, measure, breakdown, subspace, andfocus fields (Fig. 6-3(c)). A preview of the fact is shown on top of the panel as a visualization chart (Fig. 6-3(a)) and the data snippet corresponding to the fact is also shown in a table at the bottom (Fig. 6- 3(d))."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data story,"Finally, the generated data story is shown in the data story view (Fig. 6-1) in a form of a storyline (Fig. 1), a factsheet (Fig. 9), or a scroll-up view (Fig. 10). The user can easily switch between differentrepresentation forms via a drop-down menu. The story view is imple- mented based on the library released by the Calliope project [1]. Inparticular, a chart library is used for visualizing individual facts anda data story library is used for showing stories in the aforementioned different forms. 6E VALUATION We evaluated Erato and the corresponding key techniques via both quantitative experiments and controlled user studies. In particular, we first verified the consistency between the fact’s vector representation and human cognition via a user study. Next, we evaluated the interpo- lation results via a quantitative experiment that measured their overall performance and a Turing test that estimated the quality of the gener- ated content from the human perspective. Finally, three case studiestogether with domain expert interviews were conducted to verify the overall usability of the system. 6.1 Evaluation of the Fact Embedding Results We conducted a user study to verify the consistency of the fact simi- larities calculated based on the facts’ embedding vectors and the fact similarities perceived by users regarding to the facts’ semantics."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data stories,"Turing Test To verify that our algorithm was able to create high- quality results from a user’s perspective, we also performed a Turing test to let users differentiate the data stories that were fully generated by human designers (denoted as Gh) from those that were partially gen- erated by our interpolation algorithm (denoted as Gm). We established the following hypotheses: H1There was no significant semantic difference between the human- generated (G h) and interpolation-based (G m) results. H2Gm’s quality was as good as that of Ghin terms of the coherence of the corresponding data stories. Procedure and Tasks. The Turing test consisted of two stages. In the first stage, we invited 2 senior graduate students to manually createshort data stories consisting of 5 data facts using our system withthe interpolation feature disabled. Both students were female from atop design college and had rich experience in designing visual data stories. They were provided with 15 datasets covering 5 different topics, including public health, society, economy, sports, and recreation. Intotal, 15 data stories ( Gh) were created based on these datasets with diverse and balanced topics (3 stories for each topic). After that, wereplaced the middle three data facts of each data story with another three data facts generated by interpolating between the first and the last Fig. 8.

(a) Percentage of stories perceives as human, (b) ratings on the quality of data stories using a 5-point Likert scale. data facts based on the proposed technique. As a result, another 15 stories (G m) were created. Here, we controlled the story length as five to make it not too short so that the interesting content could be captured but also not too long so that the participants could easily read them without spending too much time. We chose to replace three middle facts as we would like to replace the human-generated facts in each data story as many as possible, so that we could clearly check whether the facts generated by our algorithm would affect the coherence of the data story or not. In the second stage. we randomly mixed all 30 stories together and put them into an online questionnaire. Another 50 participants (18males and 32 females, mean age 28.78) were invited to differentiate these data stories. These participants had diverse backgrounds. Some of them were university students majoring in design, architecture, com- puter science, and mathematics. Some of them were employees inan IT consulting company, faculty members in a university, and datajournalists from a news media."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data story,"Fig. 8(b) showed the results of the second task ( T2), where y-axis indicated the Likert rating on the data story quality. Again, there was no significant difference ( α=0.05,p=0.06) between two groups, but Ghhad a better average rating Human (M= 3.79, SD= 0.39) than that of GmErato (M= 3.51, SD= 0.32)(Fig. 8(b)), thus H2 accepted as well. Feedback. During the study, almost all the participants indicated that the data stories were very subjective and they relied primarily on their intuitions to make inferences. They also left their reasons and comments on their choices which were summarized as follows: •Logicality, regarding the narrative structures. Three participants pointed out that stories created by people tended to have more com- plex narrative structures, such as the three-act structures, but “the algorithm tends to generate a parallel structure”. At the same time they also mentioned “it is difficult to differentiate stories with a time- oriented structure”."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data storytelling,"The third expert was a data journalist who had more than 4 years of working experience and was familiar with data storytelling and data story authoring. Datasets We collected three datasets covering three different top- ics: natural environment (D1), entertainment (D2), and sports competi- tion (D3). Specifically, D1contained all the natural disasters worldwide since 2000 (8958 rows, 9 columns). It recorded disaster types, sub-types, year, month, country, region, continent, the number of deaths,and affected people."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data story,"Each expert then spent 10 minutes familiarizing him/herself with Erato and was asked to use it to create a data story consisting of six data facts with the given dataset based on Erato. All the experts were encouraged to think aloud during the creation process. In order not to interfere with their creative thinking, we did not set any time limit to the process. The expertsmight work as long as they want."
A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data stories,"After creating the stories, interviews were performed separately to collect their comments on three aspects: (1) the coherence of the interpolated facts and the usefulness of the technique; (2) theoverall quality of the generated data stories, and (3) the usability ofErato. Each interview lasted for about one hour with the processes recorded for later analysis. Study Results We first reviewed the stories generated by our expert users during the case study and then presented their comments on our techniques and systems that were collected during the interview. The authored data stories. Three data stories authored by our ex- perts were illustrated in Fig. 1, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10.

A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data story,"All the experts agreed the pro- posed interpolation technique was very helpful in terms of supporting both data exploration in context (E1) and data story editing (E2,3). In particular, E1mentioned “this feature [interpolation] is able to provide meaningful insights in the context ... is better than the quick insightfeatures provided in other BI tools that can only generate random in- sights”. E2was also impressed by our interpolation algorithm. She felt “it is a smart function that helps complete a smooth data story”.

She also felt the design of the system was “intuitive” and “easy to get started quickly”. E3 said, “I can easily create a data story with the help of the system”. She mentioned “it is very important to let users input the keyframes, which gives them a right to control [the content and structure of] the story”. At the same time, she also agreed that “interpolation feature will save users’ efforts” and “let them focus more on the important part”. E1felt the tool was able to “help people explore the insights in the data and support users to express their ideas”. 7L IMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK While the evaluation results indicate Erato is promising to help users create insightful and fluent data stories, the system still has several limitations that were found during the implementation or mentioned by the participants during interviews. We hope to guide potential future research directions by pointing out these limitations. Enriching Visualization.

Improving Performance and Quality. The design and implementa- tion of the current system have some performance bottlenecks.

A24,Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,1,1,data stories,"The quality of the embedding model could be further improved by training it based on data stories with more sophisticated designs. In addition, although the proposed algorithm is able to generate meaningful data facts, it cannot create soulful stories that are able to affect readers. Conducting Thorough Evaluations. In this work, we did not com- pare the data stories generated based on Erato with those automatically generated ones as we cannot control the story topic even using the state-of-the-art automatic story generation technique. Second, the Turing test also has limitations as the quality of the human-generated stories could be affected by Erato’s editing functionality. More in-depth evaluations may help us identify more pain points and future directions. 8C ONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented Erato, the first intelligent system de- signed for supporting human-machine cooperative data story design. The system employs a fact interpolation algorithm to create intermedi- ate facts that smooth the transition between two succeeding data facts. The proposed technique was evaluated via a series of evaluations in- cluding a Turing test, a controlled user study, a performance validation, and interviews with expert users. The evaluation showed the proposed technique is sound and well accepted by our users."

The effect of visual representations embedded in jour- nalistic articles has been addressed mainly by research in journalism and framing studies, where the notion of visual framing focuses on the characteristics of images and their respective effects on readers and their sensemaking [13]. Most framing studies on photographs and illustrations [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] suggest that images hold a stronger framing effect than text alone. They can directly influence behavior and increase the likelihood of acting in response to the presented stimuli [18], [19]."

We define attitudinal effects as a change in attitudes towards a specific topic. We focus our research on attitude changes as they can be considered a central effect of data stories. So far, there is limited understanding of the ways different types of visual representations can alter attitudes."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"Therefore, as we seek to shed light on the attitudinal effects of visual representation in data stories, we will measure persuasion, emotion and information retention in an empirical study. We also consider it necessary to study these dimensions in combination, and not in isolation as has been done in previous visualization studies on emotions [e.g., 26, 27], persuasiveness [28], and memorability [e.g., 29, 30]. Furthermore, despite constituting essential components of articles, visual representations—in particular, information visualizations—are usually analyzed independently of their context, i.e., separate from the story text. Visualization schol- ars tend to construct laboratory settings to study the impact of journalistic data visualization on readers [e.g., 8], [31], possibly as an attempt to contribute clear methodologies and results."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"For this purpose, we present a web-based study of an instrumented data story with responses collected immediately before and after reading the story, and after a week. By comparing three different versions of the article (illustration-only, datavis, and combined) we observe how attitudes change based on which visual stimuli are present and how they are perceived when combined. We compare the effects of visualizations and illustrations on readers’ attitudes along three crucial dimensions: persuasion, emotion, and information reten- tion. Our findings suggest that data-driven articles, where information is visually rendered by charts and maps, have a higher impact on readers’ attitude compared to articles containing illustrations alone. 2 B ACKGROUND In this section, we first address the types of visual repre- sentations which are the focus of our research, how these have been studied previously and how our approach differs."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"We chose them as two distinct visual representations that tend to be used in combination in infographics and data stories, and seem to serve distinct communicative functions. While data visualizations represent abstract data [33], illustrations depict concrete objects and scenes. Arguably, the former suggests a kind of evidence potentially based on official or scientific sources and which people see as impartial, therefore trusting them [34], [35], while the latter com- municates a topic in a more figurative way. Moreover, it plays a role in several studies on visualization that, through different approaches, have given an account of their un- derlying communicative techniques and their relationship with visualization."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"Two distinct visual representations embedded in a data story about the water crisis in Chile: an illustration of an almost dried up riverbed (left) and a visualization of varying rainfall in a territory (right) to play a key role in how people make choices and perform actions [21]. The foundations of the most widely accepted theoretical model of persuasion is ELM (Elaboration Like- lihood Model), which relies on personal relevance ascribed towards a topic [22]. The role of visualization in persuading viewers has been addressed in different domains, including environmental governance [40], climate change [41], [42] and human rights [43]. Pandey et al. [28] experimentally studied the persuasive power of visualization, and identi- fied that charts rather than tables lead to higher persuasion when participants do not possess a strong initial attitude about the topic."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"This en- abled us to compare the role of visualization and illustration in data stories, while exploring these visual representations’ effects on readers. In particular, we are interested in the immediate and short-term change (or stability) of attitudes, emotions, and correct response rates. 3.1 Article design & visual artifacts We wrote, designed and developed one article that encapsu- lates different types of visual representations. This allowed us to ensure that participants had not read it beforehand. We also had precise control of the article characteristics that are relevant for the study."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"We implemented three versions of the same data story on the water crisis in Chile: Participants read one of three versions; version Awith illustrations only, version Bwith visualizations only, and version AB with both. The narrative of the data story was organized in 4 sections (A dry future, Mining thread, An unequal flow, A leaking system). In the figure we present screenshots of each section. showing how visual representations are related with text in each condition ( A,BandAB). The complete stories can be seen in the supplementary material. number of illustrations versus visualizations, simplicity of the visualizations, and other factors. The article is a long read introducing and discussing the Chilean water crisis."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"We conducted a survey of data stories about water issues where the use of maps and infographics is persistent [e.g 57,58,59]. We follow essential characteristics of data stories, in order to maintain a realistic design with an alternation of text, data visualization and other elements (e. g., illustration, photograph, video) in a sequential structure. Data visual- ization in particular is often positioned close to the key arguments of the article, in order to provide readers with empirical evidence [6]. Illustrations are usually included to provide readers with visual context and clues about the story. Combining text, illustrations and visualizations, we generated three different versions of the same article."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"However, we are moving toward a better understanding of visual representations’ effects on data stories. 3.3.1 Apparatus and participants A call for participants was spread over social media. Au- thors used their institutional and personal profiles across various platforms to involve potential readers. Participants had to be at least 18 years old and live in Chile. The entire study was conducted in Spanish."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"We began to examine the responses by defining guiding questions to help the research team decide what we wanted to know: What were the effects of visual representations in data stories on readers? Can we compare differences between the two types of visual representations: illustra- tions ( A), visualizations ( B), or the use of both ( AB)?. In t1, we sought to identify the visual representations’ immediate impacts on participants’ reading experience. Analysis of the responses in t2would tell us about the lasting impact on readers’ memory of the visual representations and the content of the text."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"We then organized the responses into the elements remembered and the types of comments readers made about the data story in general. After each sub- category, we added a number in parenthesis representing their occurrence in the responses. We included some illustra- tive quotes from participants in the most relevant findings of this study as well. Quotes are reported and translated intoEnglish, with participant number and condition, e.g., [P123, AB].OQ1 stands for Open Question 1. 4.2.1 Roles of visual representations When analyzing responses to the question about the utility of the visual representations ( t1-OQ1 ) the first thing we ob- serve is that most readers in condition Bexplicitly stated that the visual artifacts were useful and impactful (39 out of 44)."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"These findings pave the way towards further research on the effect of visualizations compared to illustrations in data-driven storytelling. We observe that the condition with only visualization (B) produces a change in attitude towards the water crisis just after reading the article which persists one week later, although with a decreasing effect size, as opposed to conditions with illustrations ( A& AB). Similarly, our results show that the visualization-only condition (B) triggered the greatest number of emotions. With information retention, we did not observe significant differences among conditions."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"Analyzing the impact produced by different types of visual representations showed us some patterns which, while they require further investigation, may have profound implications for their use in data stories. First, when welook at the changes in the order that readers gave to the causes of the water crisis, we see that the cause of “water management and institutional deficiencies”, rose right after reading the article in the conditions with visualization ( B& AB). This can be explained by the use of a particular diagram used in conditions BandAB(see supplementary material), which represents the number and variety of actors involved in water management. This diagram may emphasize that particular idea."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"These two different findings could be important for designing a data story: Do we want readers to concentrate on the content of the article, or the form? If we want readers to focus on the article for its content rather than its visualizations, these may need to be less prominent. Complex arguments can be enhanced by visualizations, and by strategically choosing where to place and how to combine them. Reader retention may be stronger or weaker as a result."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"This result suggests that visualizations act as a “call to action”, which might be relevant for authors of data stories who seek to trigger readers’ actions toward the subject presented. 5.2 Limitations Although our approach is effective and our results are promising, some limitations should be considered. 5.2.1 Measuring emotions According to our qualitative analysis, visualizations in par- ticular elicit different emotional responses among readers compared to the emotion measured in the questionnaire of the study. This may be a result of the type of measurement we used (see section 3.4). While the issues presented in a data story vary widely, the instrument measures a limited number of emotions.

A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"This is due to how different formats usually present information. ”Scrollytelling” has become a common and recognized technique in data stories, and it is fairly common for visualizations to be dynamic. On the other hand, illus- trations are often single static objects. Future work should concentrate on this difference, since animations could bemore attractive for readers and ensure a similar treatment for different types of visual representations. While visualizations are becoming more common in the context of journalism, they still require a different level of data literacy in comparison to static illustrations."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"The purpose of this study was to examine three real-world news articles, each of which works as an informative data story about environmental issues. We have made every effort possible to create realistic and representative conditions; however, we fully acknowledge that this does not and can not present generalizable results covering other topics. Another aspect to consider is the topic to be covered in the article. Some topics may benefit more from one type of visual representation than another, such as those that require both data representation and process explanation (e.g., creating a new vaccine, the effects of a hurricane, etc.)."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data stories,"Given an explicit call to action (e.g. donation, sign a petition, etc.), would visualizations make data stories more actionable than illustrations? Investigating this aspect could also help clarify why negative arguments generate positive emotional activation as in the case of our quantitative and qualitative results. Another way forward could be to look at differences between photographs and visualizations with a similar ap- proach. For instance, we could ask: Do visualizations influence readers’ attitude as strongly as photographs?"
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"Although the results we obtained are promising, they are based solely on one data story published in three variants. We consider that adding entirely different data stories and running a similar experimental study to test similar hypotheses would add more external validity to the conclusions. Future work could consider running a similar experiment with multiple stories that have multiple variations, for example, in textual length or topical scope. One could also consider extending the measurement and compare the differences between a text-only article and versions with different visual representations (e.g. videos, photos)."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"The positioning and distribution of visual representations and text within a data story could influence reader attitude changes. Future research could consider studying the impact that visuals and their position may have, incorporating variables such as the semantic and spatial proximity of visual representations to text. Finally, in order to separate the effects of visual conditions compared to previous knowledge of the topic, we also suggest including questions to assess participants’ expertise about the water crisis. 6 C ONCLUSION As journalistic forms of storytelling change to accommodate a wide range of contents including data, visualizations play an ever-increasing role for informing about issues of public concern. There has already been considerable research on other visual representations in news media, but there has been little evidence on visualizations’ effect on attitude changes."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"We researched the role of visual representations via one particular data story about a current topic that proved to be a promising strategy. Weformulated 6 hypotheses in order to test different visual artifacts’ effects (visualization compared to illustrations and their interaction) upon attitudinal change, emotions, and information retention by conducting a user study. Our main conclusions are summarized as follows. With this research we contribute insights on the attitudinal effects of visualization both in comparison to and in combination with illustration."
A26,Attitudinal effects of data visualizations and illustrations in data stories,1,1,data story,"First, our results suggest that using only visualizations within a data story can have a significant effect on attitudinal changes. Second, they can also trigger a higher number of emotions, which leads us to think that the change in attitude may be related to the emotional im- pact they generate, even though claiming this relationship needs further research. Third, visual representation type has no statistically significant effect on information retention; however, the qualitative analysis has provided evidence of a considerably higher level of detail and elaboration in the free-form responses regarding articles which feature visualizations. These are important indications about the attitudinal effect of visualizations, in particular regarding complex issues such as environmental crises."

A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"1 How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools Qing Chen, Shixiong Cao, Jiazhe Wang, and Nan Cao Abstract —In recent years, narrative visualization has gained much attention. Researchers have proposed different design spaces for various narrative visualization genres and scenarios to facilitate the creation process. As users’ needs grow and automation technologies advance, increasingly more tools have been designed and developed. In this study, we summarized six genres of narrative visualization (annotated charts, infographics, timelines & storylines, data comics, scrollytelling & slideshow, and data videos) based on previous research and four types of tools (design spaces, authoring tools, ML/AI-supported tools and ML/AI-generator tools) based on the intelligence and automation level of the tools. We surveyed 105 papers and tools to study how automation can progressively engage in visualization design and narrative processes to help users easily create narrative visualizations. This research aims to provide an overview of current research and development in the automation involvement of narrative visualization tools. We discuss key research problems in each category and suggest new opportunities to encourage further research in the related domain. Index Terms —Data Visualization; Automatic Visualization; Narrative Visualization; Design Space; Authoring Tools; Survey ✦ 1 I NTRODUCTION DAta visualization has been broadly applied to communicate data and information in an effective and expressive manner. Recently, an emerging trend has been to combine narrative and storytelling with visualization [1]. The norms of communicative and exploratory information visualization are used in narrative visualizations in order to tell the desired story [2]. However, creating visualizations with narrative information is a challenging and time-consuming task."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Therefore, by summarizing the experience in practice, researchers specify various design spaces and visualization scenarios for distinct narrative genres, which are used to guide users to create narrative visualizations. With the emergence of new user requirements and the ad- vancement of automation technology, an increasing number of intelligent tools have been created to assist the visual creative process. Authoring tools offer rich interactions that allow users to adequately control the creation process. However, such tools still require users to decide on each visualization element manually."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"ML/AI- supported tools usually provide recommendations as part of the narrative visualization creation process. Normally, users need to make their own design choices to achieve the design outcome. However, ML/AI-generator tools do not require user expertise in visualization and can generate a complete set of visualization designs without user intervention. •Qing Chen, Shixiong Cao, and Nan Cao are with Intel- ligent Big Data Visualization Lab, Tongji University.

A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Therefore, a state-of-the-art survey is required to provide a better understanding of automation involvement in narrative visualization creation tools. To fill this gap, we collected 91 design spaces and tools covering the six genres of narrative visualization and classified them into four automation levels, allowing us to describe how automatic techniques could be progressively used in visualization design and visual narrative, further allowing users to create data visualizations. By analyzing the tools of each narrative visualization genre, we compared the focus of the four levels of tools in each narrative genre in order for users to easily choose the appropriate tool to create according to different scenarios. Furthermore, we identified both mature and less-explored research directions for automated visual narrative tools and presented new research problems and future work to assist researchers in advancing their grasp of the subject matter and pursuing their investigations. In addition to the state-of-art survey, we developed an interactive browser to facilitate the exploration and presentation of the collected design spaces and tools at http://autovis.idvxlab.com/. 2 R ELATED SURVEY AND TAXONOMY In this section, we first perform a literature review on narrative visualization.

Then, we present our survey scope and methodology. Finally, we describe the taxonomy of this survey. 2.1 Narrative Visualization and Storytelling Process Our research is influenced by the emergence of narrative visual- ization theories and visual storytelling technologies. According to Segel et al. [98], narrative visualization comprises three essential components: narrative genres, narrative structure (methods for or- ganizing plot or information), and visual narrative (visual methods for generating story experiences and transmitting messages). Hullman et al. [74] provided a summary of how automated sequencing might be included in design systems to assist users in making organized choices when developing narrative visuals.According to Lee et al. [6], aiming to achieve the goal of message delivery, visual data stories must have a collection of narrative segments backed by data and presented in a coherent order. In addition, the process of creating narrative visualizations is not always linear. This approach can be roughly categorized into three steps: investigating the data, making a story, and telling the story. Tong et al. [99] surveyed the literature on storytelling in visualization, covering the logical concepts of who is the subject of the narrative visual (creation tool and audience), how the story is told (narration and transition), and why we can use visual narratives (memory and interpretation). The goal for this research is to provide researchers and practitioners with an overview of the development and research for various narrative visualization tools. 2.2 Related Survey This section outlines the surveys related to automated visualization techniques and tools. Wang et al. [3] surveyed 88 papers on ML4VIS and explained seven main processes of machine learning techniques applied to visualization: Data Processing4VIS, Data-VIS Mapping, Insight Communication, Style Imitation, VIS Interaction, VIS Reading, and User Profiling. Wu et al. [4] reviewed recent advances in artificial intelligence techniques applied to visual data, examining a number of key research questions related to the development and management of visual data and the support provided by artificial intelligence for these operations. The study by Zhu et al. [5] is the most relevant to us, in which they investigated automated visualization techniques for infographics."

Tong et al. [99] emphasized in their research that narrative visualization focuses more on information visualization than scientific visualiza- tion. In addition, studies on narrative scientific visualization haveThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.

A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"We started with a collection of references on the categorization of narrative visualization in this area for the selection of reference-driven, and we then broadened the focus by looking up both citing and cited publications. We completed two rounds of article gathering for the search-based choices. A preliminary search for narrative visualizations, relevant design tools, and best practices was conducted in the first round by using high-impact visualization conferences and publications. In particular, we selected five conferences (ACM CHI, IEEE InfoVis, IEEE V AST, IEEE PacificVis and IV) and five journals (IEEE TVCG, IEEE CGA, and ACM Transactions on Graphics, Computer Graphics Forum, Visual Informatics). We gathered a variety of publications by using two search terms (“visualization” and “design space/design guide,” “visualization” and “authoring tool”) and then evaluated abstracts and full texts to narrow down our sample. After this round of article selection, 348 papers and tools were obtained."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"To achieve a more precise review of the literature about narrative visualization, we used narrative visualization genres and tools (e.g., “data comics” and “design space/authoring tool,” “infographics” and “design space/authoring tools,” etc.) to categorize the papers. Furthermore, we removed programming tools and domain-specific application tools, as they are beyond the scope of this research. Finally, 91 narrative visualization papers and tools are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1. In Table 1 and Figure 1 we excluded commercial software mainly because most of them do not have a definite publication date, and commercial software tends to have frequent updates and additional features, which makes it difficult to fix a specific year. 2.4 Taxonomy In this section, we will first describe the four levels of automation and then introduce the detailed classification of narrative visualiza- tion in our survey. 2.4.1 Tool Classification Method In this section, we categorize the visualization tools into four groups based on their automation and intelligence [5], [37]. Design space is a conceptual set of possibilities rather than a software tool [100]. Design space stresses the ability to choose from a variety of possibilities and investigate alternatives [101], [102]."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"When the user uploads the data, this type of tool automates the process and analysis of the data and can generate a complete set of visual design solutions without user intervention. 2.4.2 Visual Classification Method Segel et al. [98] presented seven genres of narrative visualization: magazine-style, annotated chart, partitioned poster, flowchart, comic strip, slideshow, film/video/animation. Recently, Roth [75] classified visual storytelling into seven genres: static visual stories, long-form infographics, dynamic slides, narrative animations, multimedia visual experiences, personalized story maps, and compilations (compilations provide a “visual abstract” that typically links to further text) [75]. On the basis of their findings and the presentation outcomes, we reclassified the narrative visualization genres (Table 2). In this re- search, magazine style, partitioned posters, and static visual stories were jointly studied and then collectively referred to as infographics. Film/video/animation, narrated animations, and multimedia visual experiences are called data videos. Slideshow, compilations, and long- form infographics are collectively called “scrollytelling & slideshow”."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"As we explored the selected tools, we discovered two standard interaction types: scrolling which includes landscape and portrait scrolling, and drawing, which supports “touch+pen” interaction. 3 A NNOTATED CHARTTABLE 2: Segel et al.

Annotations allow audiences to focus on specific content or critical information while retaining complete details of the contextual data [106], [107]. Design space: Adding annotations to visualizations makes the detailed information more accessible to users and improves the memorability of the images [8]."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Bryan et al. [14] focused on narrative visualizations for multivariate, time-varying datasets. They proposed a method called Temporal Summary Images (TSI) consisting of temporal layout, data snapshots in the form of comic strips, and textual annotations. Moreover, researchers have noted that line graphs are the most common type of visualization in daily life [111]. However, some line charts are deceptive with exaggeration, understatement, and message reversal."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Bach et al. [44] proposed the concept of time curves for nonlinear narrative visualization. The aims of their work were to provide a general method for producing straightforward visual summaries for a variety of temporal datasets. The researchers describe the visual patterns that time curves often display (i.e., cluster, transition, cycle, U-turn, outlier, oscillation, and alternation) and how to interpret them. Similarly, Kim et al. [48] suggested the use of story curves to analyze and convey nonlinear narratives in film."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,data story,"In a fact sheet, a data story is constructed from several facts and numerical or statistical findings produced from data [69]. Although some comic elements are missing in fact sheets, we still categorize them in this category because they can be easily extended to data comics by adding some comic-style decorations. Both DataShot [69] and Calliope [70] can automatically generate fact sheets. DataShot [69] transforms tabular data into fact sheets by adopting a three-step process of fact extraction, fact combination, and visual synthesis."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,data stories,"This method is extended by Calliope [70] to automatically construct visual data stories from spreadsheets and use the Monte-Carlo-tree search technique to investigate tale fragments and portray them in a logical manner. Calliope can generate coherent visual data stories in which logical connections can be maintained between the preceding and following segments. In this manner, the threshold for creating data stories can be effectively decreased. Summary: Although in its infancy now, data comics have gained much attention in recent years. According to some prelimi- nary studies [56], data comics perform better than slideshows and infographics in terms of spatial efficiency and reader enjoyment. However, a more detailed evaluation with a larger number of participants needs to be conducted to validate its usage and effectiveness in practice."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Hullman et al. [74] analyzed 42 narrative visualizations in the form of slides and investigated how the choice of order affects narrative visualization. For slideshows, the narrative is told by discrete clicking, tapping, keying, or swiping dynamic slideshows, allowing the designer to control the storytelling pace. In addition, users can add or remove pages to the slideshows according to their needs and can exit the presentation page at any time. Slide layouts can show continuous progress between slides or support nonlinear breaks in the narrative [75]."

A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Data video is a narrative visualization type [98] that combines data visualization with motion graphics and tells data-driven stories. Data videos can present viewers with diverse visual information in a short period, and therefore, they are widely used in disseminating data information [80], [90]. Design space: Researchers have primarily focused on under- standing, creating, and disseminating data videos. Amini et al. [80] first proposed a visual narrative structure theory, in which the narrative structure of data video can be divided into four roles: establisher (E), initial (I), peak (P), and release (R)."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Shi et al. [88] analyzed 43 animation techniques for narrative visualizations and categorized eight narrative strategies (e.g., emphasis, suspense, and comparison) to construct a design space. This design space helps describe how data videos are produced and how various components are integrated with visual narrative strategies. Such design spaces provide users with useful design suggestions; thus, they weaken the barriers to designingand producing expressive data videos. By examining animated data charts, Tang et al. [89] created a design space for data videos with five dimensions: data, motion, layout, duration, and narrative."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Second, researchers also a need to study how the speed, continuity, and smoothness of animations in data videos, the transitions between charts and graphs, and the embellishment effects added to the videos would affect the understanding and overall experience of readers [91]. 9 D ISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this section, we outline the current limitations and future research opportunities of design spaces and tools at different automation levels for narrative visualization. Design space aims to describe all the possible design aspects for various narrative genres. The summary of the design space allows us to capture some implicit knowledge of visual designers and practitioners [104]. Most existing studies propose clear design guidelines in specific design scenarios [60], [89], [137]."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Information on the application of narrative structures in novels and plays in narrative visualizations is generally lacking in the extant literature. Due to the different characteristics of various narrative genres, the choice of narrative structure can also be different. For example, a timeline mainly presents content in a linear narrative sequence [50], whereas in data videos, using a nonlinear narrative approach is more likely to engage the audience [43]. Therefore, a potential research direction is to explore different data types and which narrative structure is more suitable for different narrative genres."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,Explore other narrative visualization genres. Some traditional visualization genres that focus more on visual analytics are embrac- ing narrative and storytelling concepts. Suprata [137] noted that adding narrative attributes to dashboards allows users to become more aware of their goals and how to take action next. Fernandez Nieto et al. [140] enhanced teachers’ guidance of the content byThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"An emerging trend is the need to study new forms of narrative visualizations. For example, the potential research direction of narrative immersive visualization is a more in-depth exploration of data types, spatial layouts, and user interactions for narrative communication in the virtual environment. The physicalization of data encodes information in a perceptible form, allowing users to explore using all their senses and motor skills [146]. More research on narrative data physicalization is still needed in the future to better understand the design space, the process of producing data, and the benefits compared with flat visualization or virtual presentation [147]."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Although these authoring tools significantly improve the efficiency of creating narrative visualizations, most tools are aimed at users with a certain level of expertise. For example, authoring tools for infographics and timelines require users to have visual design skills, while data videos require users to have video editing skills. Future research may invest more efforts in the following directions. Develop flexible interfaces for authoring tools."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"However, other narrative visualization tools are relatively lacking. More flexible interface methods should be provided to help designers achieve more creative ideas and more artistic effects in creating various narrative visualizations. Develop more interactive visualizations . Among the existing narrative visualization genres, only scrollytelling and slideshow have strong interactive properties, while annotated charts, info- graphics, data comics, and data videos are mostly static visu- alizations that lack interactive functionality. However, studies have proven that by providing interactivity [66] and adding interesting [26], [27] and emotional factors [25] to the visualization, users are more likely to memorize the information. Therefore, in future research, a possible approach is to explore more narrative genres of interactive visualizations and to add interesting and emotional elements. ML/AI-supported tools are designed to assist users in visualization creation by applying intelligent algorithms and techniques."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"ML/AI-supported toolsfor narrative visualizations can serve a wider range of users than authoring tools. For example, designers who lack data analytic skills can easily create data comics with the data analysis capabilities of ML/AI-supported tools; data analysts who lack design skills can use ML/AI-supported tools to create more aesthetically pleasing timelines or data videos. However, the automatic goals and functions of current ML/AI- supported tools for different narrative visualization types are different. For example, tools for annotated charts, infographics, and data comics have the auxiliary function of identifying and parsing visualizations. Among them, the purpose of annotated chart recognition is to add annotations to facilitate comprehension of the visual story; the purpose of infographic recognition is to create new visualizations based on the original visual styles; and the purpose of data comics recognition is to transform visual content into the comic layout. ML/AI-supported tools for timelines focus on placing timeline text and optimizing visual aesthetic effects, while data videos pay more attention to the creation of animation."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"By summarizing existing research in ML/AI-supported tools for narrative visualization, the following directions can be studied. Enhance the research of annotation tools. Although the annotated chart is one specific genre in narrative visualization, annotations are important for any visualization. It can help users understand the visualization and help data analysts review the past analysis process [112]. However, the ability to add annotations to visualizations is lacking in ML/AI-supported tools for different narrative visualizations [93]. Moreover, the annotations generated by most existing tools can only explain the statistical information on a single chart [32], [148]. Studies are generally lacking in terms of applying intelligent techniques to extract context information to build visualizations with narrative structures. Improve the reusability of existing visualizations."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"By improving the reusability of existing narrative visualizations, amateurs are able to create more visual stories efficiently and effectively [93]. Facilitate the adaptability of different software. Some exist- ing tools are integrated with office software. For example, all the features of the DataComicsJS [56] tool can be replicated in presentation tools (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint [128]) and drawing tools (e.g., Adobe Illustrator [117])."

A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"Among the current six genres of narrative visualizations, ML/AI-generator tools that can be used for timelines are generally lacking. Even though certain intelligent tools can be used to create a timeline, they only modify the local area. Completing the entire creation remains time-consuming. While several ML/AI-generator tools for other genres, such as Autoclips [97], can analyze the data and extract essential parameters from the dataset, the final output is not satisfactory when facing different datasets, different contexts, or more complex data types."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"However, research on such tools, specifically for narrative visualization, is lacking. This situation can be explained by recommendation methods being based on data characteristics or design guidelines rather than the user’s design intent. One potential research direction is to develop a narrative visualization recommendation platform, where both the design process and design outcomes of visualizations are stored on the platform. By analyzing the collected information, we could identify the user’s design intent with the help of machine learning algorithms [154]. Such recommendation tools can provide users with abundant design ideas and recommendations in the pre-creation stage of narrative visualizations. This study outlines four narrative visualization tools at the automation level. Furthermore, although the different tools are divided into different narrative visualization genres in this study, it does not mean that these tools can only create one genre of narrative visualization. The tools present certain compatibility across different genres of narrative visualizations. However, novice users need to undergo a learning curve to varying degrees for either visualization tool type. Moreover, these visualization tools can only tell users how the data have changed, without explaining why it has changed, suggesting that the user will still need to analyze the reasons for the data change results. Moreover, a one-size-fits-all tool to handle all scenarios to address different users and goals does not exist."
A27,How Does Automation Shape the Process of Narrative Visualization: A Survey of Tools,1,1,narrative visualization,"More efforts can be invested in such human-centered ML/AI-supported narrative visualization tools in the future. 10 C ONCLUSION In this study, we systematically reviewed 105 papers and tools to study how automation can progressively engage in visualization design and narrative processes to help users create narrative visualizations more easily, effectively, and efficiently. We have sum- marized six genres of narrative visualization (i.e., annotated charts, infographics, timeline & storyline, data comics, scrollytelling & slideshow, and data videos) based on previous research, and four types of tools (i.e., design space, authoring tool, ML/AI-supported tool, ML/AI-generator tool) based on the intelligence and automa- tion level of the tools. This study enables users to comprehend the explicit and implicit design elements of various narrative visualization genres, facilitating the selection of appropriate tools for visual storytelling. However, our survey excluded scientific visualization. In the field of scientific visualization, narrative visualization has been applied in scenarios such as climate or medical condition narratives [155]."

A28,Towards Visualization Thumbnail Designs That Entice Reading Data-Driven Articles,1,1,data stories,"Our work can thus be seen as a first step toward providing structured guidance on how to design compelling thumbnails for data stories. Index Terms —Data journalism, data-driven storytelling, online news, visualization, thumbnail images, data stories. ✦ 1 I NTRODUCTION THUMBNAILS are small and static images that accom- pany titles and bylines in documents [1], [2], [3]. News organizations have extensively used thumbnails for their online news articles to induce reader attention and attract clicks. As data stories —where visualization plays an im- portant role—grow in popularity, news organizations are starting to publish thumbnails that incorporate visualization into the thumbnails. These visualization thumbnails are differ- ent from conventional thumbnails because they have great potential to both convey an article’s main message using its embedded visualization as well as entice the reader to click on the article link based on the appeal of the displayed data. Several news media outlets have begun to adopt such visualization thumbnails. For example, The New York Times presents many visualization thumbnails in its data story dedicated section “The Upshot."" FiveThirtyEight showcases many visualization thumbnails that can effectively catch the reader’s attention. Although many types of visualization thumbnails have been designed, few studies have inves- tigated the variety of design choices. As a result, many questions remain unanswered about optimal visualization thumbnail design. For example, “The Upshot” and The Economist tend to use thumbnails that are resized from visualizations embedded in the article."

A28,Towards Visualization Thumbnail Designs That Entice Reading Data-Driven Articles,1,1,data stories,"Abundant axes information may gain readers’ trust but are rarely used for understanding data stories: One characteristic of  thumbnails is that they are the only type of thumbnails that provide complete axes information (e.g., axis labels and values). We first found that participants welcome the detailed axis information in  thumbnails for an accurate understanding of data stories. Nine of 27 participants chose the axis information as to their selection reason. P25 stated—“ The clearly visible labels on the x- and y- axis, [...] effective scale helped me quickly understand it ."" We also noticed that thumbnails with full axes information might help readers perceive trustworthiness and professionalism from the articles (two of 27), as P19 states—“ I can say that the thumbnail is my pick because it lays the tone of professionalism. "" P25 also expressed a similar opinion—“ [...] most convincing and less likely to be skewed due to the clearly visible labels on the x and y axis. "" However, participants did not use the axis information extensively for interpretation. Instead, 10 of 27 participants focused on overall line chart trends (e.g., P4: “ fluctuations of the graph make me wonder [...] "", P5: “ Apple is dropping [...] ""), which can be done quickly and easily."
A28,Towards Visualization Thumbnail Designs That Entice Reading Data-Driven Articles,1,1,data stories,"Data labels with highlights can provide a visual guide for readers: Highlights [18], [52], [53] and reference lines [33], [66], [67] have been effective methods for at- tracting readers and enhancing readers’ understandability of data stories with visualization. We confirmed the effec- tiveness of these techniques in thumbnails. For example, reference lines (e.g., the black horizontal lines of thumbnails in Figure 3) tend to make participants read data stories in chronological order, working as anchors for the data labels [33], [66], [67]. Nine of 53 participants described how they understand the thumbnails with  thumb- nails, directly referring to the data labels—“ I chose this article (Article 2) [...] it was nearly a 50/50 split on January 23, 2017, and on October 19, 2019 [...] ,"" (P96)."

Among the visualization thumbnails used in the exper- iments, we conjecture that the  thumbnails seem to support the story summary strategy by presenting a baseline story with the time-series data and exposing the main point with the red highlight and data label. This can be related to picture superiority effect, in which image content is more likely to lead to an increased understanding of the material [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76]. As we did not consider the message presentation strategy in our thumbnail design, there exist many questions on the matter."

From early infographics to recent data-driven storytelling, visualization has become an integrated part of contemporary journalism, primarily as a communication artifact to inform the general public. Data journalism, harnessing the power of data visualization, has emerged as a bridge between the growing volume of data and our society. Visualization research that centers around data storytelling has sought to understand and facilitate such journalistic endeavors. However, a recent metamorphosis in journalism has brought broader challenges and opportunities that extend beyond mere communication of data. We present this article to enhance our understanding of such transformations and thus broaden visualization research’s scope and practical contribution to this evolving field. We first survey recent significant shifts, emerging challenges, and computational practices in journalism."
A29,More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Index Terms —journalism, data visualization, computational journalism, data-driven storytelling ✦ 1 I NTRODUCTION DATA interacts with journalism in many ways. One of the most important ways is the communication of data, frequently performed through charts and visualizations. Newspapers were among the first media to bring infograph- ics to the public’s attention, with well-known examples like USA Today’s Snapshots, which often employed embellished and straightforward graphics [1]. More recently, enhanced web-based interactive visualization technologies, notably D3.js [2], have given rise to new forms to communicate data stories. Mainstream news platforms like The Guardian, The New York Times, and The Washington Post were early adopters and trailblazers of such Web-based interactive and dynamic visual communication. Following them, a new generation of websites, such as FiveThirtyEight and the Pudding, has emerged in the midst of this wave, progres- sively gaining attention from broader audiences. While data journalism exhibits promise, conventional journalism has been facing increasing challenges and turbu- lence [3], [4]."

In addition, the traditional perspec- tive regarding news organizations as fixed institutions does not adequately consider today’s increasingly dynamic and participatory information environment. We believe it is an appropriate time to review the state of contemporary journalism and explore how data visualiza- tion research can contribute to the discipline’s growth and evolution. In particular, we ask: •In light of the recent shifts in the information land- scape and journalistic metamorphosis, what new vi- sualization research opportunities could emerge at this intersection? •How could visualization research contextualize its work to address broader challenges in journalism?"

Automators also have the potential to complete this process by generating journalistic content directly from structured data. The news consumption process starts when audiences encounter these products and decide to engage. Such engagement with visualization can provide casual (i.e., awareness, social, reflective) insights, curiosity, or simple entertainment."
A29,More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Recent data-driven storytelling that employs interactivity enables audiences to dive further and engage in preliminary exploration, invoking visualizations’ value as Analyzers . In today’s participatory environment, if a Public Forum (participatory opportunity) is provided, interested audiences can easily transition into the creators’ role, triggering further analytical engagement and completing the circle. Second, journalism is a type of public communication — the social influence should not be overlooked, especially in the increasingly participatory journalism environment. Therefore, we propose to borrow Domingo et al.’s theoret- ical model on inclusive public communication and derived analytical grid (access/observation, selection/filtering, pro- cessing/editing, distribution, interpretation ) [27] as a lens."
A29,More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism,1,1,narrative visualization,"By doing so, we intend to provide a map for future visual- ization research to position itself and inspire investigations beyond current mainstream practices. 5.1 Facilitating Data Communication Subtopic 1.1: Facilitate Narrative Visualization Author- ing (Facilitator) Agenda : Support sophisticated and expressive narrative visualization creation while lowering the barrier Literature : [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112] Supporting more sophisticated and expressive interac- tive visualization creation while lowering the barrier for data visualization authoring has always been a central focus for visualization researchers. Visualization researchers have explored different forms of tools to author engaging nar- rative visualizations. For example, SketchStory [104] allows users to sketch narrative visualization in a freeform way with pen and touch interactions. Ellipsis[113] decouples nar- rative structure from visualization creation and allows users to create visualization scenes, add annotations and organize storylines. Recent tools like Lyra [105], Data Illustrator [106], and Charticulator [107], focus on expressive authoring and distinguish themselves from prior template editors and shelf constructions (e.g., Tableau). According to Satyanarayan et al. [114], such authoring tools, including subsequent Lyra 2 [108] and Data Animator [109], often assume authors’ familiarity with computational thinking and are already acquainted with datasets [114]."
A29,More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism,1,1,narrative visualization,"Subtopic 1.2: Bridge the gap between exploration and presentation (Facilitator) Agenda : Allow journalists to visually explore data, obtain insights, then organize the insights into engaging visual presentations (e.g., narrative visualization) in a more effi- cient and seamless way Literature : [117], [118], [119] A salient feature of journalists’ information intermediary role is that they need to perform both analytical and commu- nicative tasks. Journalists are usually knowledgeable of their domains but less data-savvy. Therefore, data acquisition and wrangling can prevent them from adopting information tools — traditional journalists are more likely to interact with information tools through direct manipulation [120] to find insights and construct narratives [117]. Narrative visualization authoring tools like Ellipsis [113] and Idyll Studio [110] do not take data analysis into consideration."
A29,More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism,1,1,narrative visualization,"Recently, visualization researchers have advocated a more seamless and integrated authoring pipeline [18], [117], [118], [119] where users can perform exploratory data analysis to discover insights and narratives, then organize them into narrative visualizations by manipulating layouts, annotat- ing, highlighting, or even re-configuring visual elements. Such integration presents new challenges and opportunities. Gratzl et al. propose the CLUE model, aiming to integrate data exploration and presentation by capturing provenance data during exploration and then apply such provenance data to presentation [118]. However, visual encodings opti- mized for exploratory purposes are not necessarily optimal for communication."

By data-driven di- alogues, we mean activities in which audiences comment and interact with others using their own analytic insights. Commenting is among the most used feature to foster user input in online journalism, especially when it comes to controversial topics such as politics [123]. Surveys [122] show people comment on the news to express emotion or opinions, add information or correct misinformation, par- ticipate in debates, etc."
A29,More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism,1,1,narrative visualization,"Segel and Heer [14] include Film/Video/Animation as a basic narrative visualization genre.

Visualization researchers havemade attempts to address these challenges. One route is to develop tools that directly facilitate data video authoring."
A29,More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism,1,1,narrative visualization,"We speculate narrative visualizations, with their capabil- ities to deliver sophisticated information in an engaging manner, could support communicating fact-checking ver- dict/analysis in a more digestible and transparent way (e.g., demonstrating a verdict’s relationships with mul- tiple sources supporting/refuting it). Another promising approach is to employ visualizations to effectively com- municate the verdicts on data-driven/statistical claims, as visualization can potentially provide context for the data claims and help audiences to comprehend the verdicts. Fu- ture research can explore the design space and evaluate its influence on audiences’ reception of fact-checking verdicts, regarding aspects such as engagement and persuasiveness.

HCI researchers have explored au- tomated news content beyond just text. Oh et al. devel- oped a system NewsRobot [192] that automatically gen- erates different types (general/personalized) and styles (text/image/sound) of news content using sports data, and they used generated news as a probe to understand audiences’ perception of different combinations of auto- mated news. Visualization researchers have studied it from a broader perspective — auto-insights, defined as “data observations revealed by automation” by Law et al. [191]."
A29,More Than Data Stories: Broadening the Role of Visualization in Contemporary Journalism,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Their review [191] found that only a few studies were dedicated to automated data-driven storytelling. Systems like DataShot [193], Temporal [194], and Calliope [195] are pushing towards more sophisticated and engaging auto- mated visual data stories while supporting human editorial intervention. This direction still imposes great technical challenges (e.g., extracting data insights, generating proper visualization, linking texts to charts, supporting sophisti- cated techniques like scrollytelling) and lacks design impli- cations and understanding of audience perceptions. Subtopic 7.2: Augment interactive visualization with automated insights and guidance (Automator) Agenda : Provide auto-generated insights and guidance based on users’ interactions to help ordinary audiences interpret data and visualization Literature : [196] With visualization dashboards permeating various areas in journalism and reaching broader audiences, the pub- lic’s need for assistance in interpreting these visualizations and extracting insights also grows.

In this study, we took a step back and examined journalism’s digital metamorphosis to identify the emerging challenges and their implications, as well as journalism’s computa- tional exploration to address such challenges and shifts. Based on our findings, we identified computing’s six roles in contemporary journalism, and their corresponding focuses. Next, we revisited discourse on the fundamental values of visualization and proposed a set of propositions about how visualization can support or be supported by computing’s six roles."

A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data storytelling,"The approach integrates visual data storytelling with data exploration, spatial annotations, and animated transitions. V-Mail “data stories” are exported in a standard video ﬁle format to establish a common baseline level of access on (almost) any device. The V-Mail framework also includes a series of complementary client applications and plugins that enable different degrees of story co-authoring and data exploration, adjusted automatically to match the capabilities of various devices. A lightweight, phone-based V-Mail app makes it possible to annotate data by adding captions to the video. These spatial annotations are then immediately accessible to team members running high-end 3D graphics visualization systems that also include a V-Mail client, implemented as a plugin."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,storytelling with data,"This approach conceptually builds closely on prior work in storytelling with data visualizations [8], [19], [31], which has been explored extensively for 2D abstract data but less so for spatial 3D data. By adopting a keyframe-based storytelling metaphor [3], [40], we have developed a system that creates animated data stories from data views captured directly from exploratory visualizations along with a mechanism of using an URL of a standard video ﬁle as the base ‘token’ for distributing a data story. By packing the communication about the data into a standard video format and sending this critical human-to-human communication rather than the raw data and visualization application, our system leverages existing e-mail and social media applications as tools for distributing stories. Many forms of storytelling are, however, collaborative activities by nature [20], [23], [42], and people often take on different roles in this process [7], [11], [23]. We, thus, also support tasks that data story audiences may carry out after an initial viewing of a story such as providing feedback to the original author, verifying claims made in the story, or even adding new content to the story. To turn data storytelling into a collaborative and iterative process, we extend our system and introduce the V(isualiza- tion)-Mail framework. The key approach is ﬂexible export of data story where a single V-Mail story token can trigger experiences with different storytelling ﬁdelities, based on the absence or presence of dedicated software (Fig. 1).

A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data storytelling,"We also present several extensions to this core idea to further enhance 3D-speciﬁc data storytelling. For example, since understanding the spatial context for speciﬁc data views is often critically important, the views are represented as 3D frames ﬂoating in the same space as the data visu- alization, enabling the audience to see them from various vintage points. In addition, to increase clarity, we employ a staged animation when the transition between data views would require changes to several visualization parameters, for example, when new data ﬁlters or color maps have been applied. In summary, the main contributions of this article are: the design of a novel visualization framework to fa- cilitate 3D-enabled multi-person correspondence about spatial datasets for team science, an extension of keyframe-based storytelling metaphors to support co-authorship, treating the created stories as collaborative documents authored asynchronously, the design of a data story server and communication protocol for using V-Mail across an ecosystem of hard- ware platforms that seamlessly adapt the ﬁdelity of the experience to the hardware, and user feedback and lessons learned from a ﬁrst evaluation of using V-Mail in a real team-science setting where team members utilized all V-Mail client platforms we created (desktop app, mobile app, and native video players on multiple mobile and web-based devices). 2 R ELATED WORK V-Mail relates to research on interactive tools, techniques, and formats for storytelling with data visualization and builds upon multiple topics (e. g., animation and annotation, inter- activity, co-authorship and collaboration) that have become consistent themes in this research. We note that, although storytelling techniques have been used for presenting both spatial [27], [28], [36], [40] and non-spatial [4], [10], [22], [23], [32], [34] data, recent work has focused more consistently on non-spatial data. V-Mail, therefore, builds upon a trend of customizing storytelling support tools for speciﬁc types of data (e. g., [3], [25], [35], [40]), but does so for the speciﬁc case of spatial 3D data, as often encountered in domains such as physics, astronomy, biology, and medicine.2.1 Co-Authoring and Interacting with Stories Many forms of storytelling are, by nature, collaborative activities [20], [23], [42] and people often take on different roles in this process [7], [11], [23]. In a recent survey, Tong et al. [36] describe authoring tools for parallel storytelling, where multiple authors work simultaneously to create the ﬁnal visualization content."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data stories,"In an accompanying text editor, authors write text-based data stories using bookmarked data views as references to claims. By scrolling the editor ﬁlled with the links, the audience has the ability not only to see the message with text descriptions but also to ﬂip through saved visualization states for further exploration. Further, by modifying text in the editor, the audience can add new content or even new data views found in their own data analysis sessions. V-Mail is similar to GeoTime in that multiple users collaborate on visualization presentations."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,narrative visualization,"V-Mails provide users with different options for consuming data stories, from passive viewing to interacting with them, as there is no one correct level of interactivity on the spectrum for constructing a narrative visualization [11], [28], [34]. While interaction can distract viewers from an initial story arc [20], the ability to interactively view data stories is typically seen as giving the audience a feeling of involvement and lends credibility [21], [27], [28], [40], [42]. Existing web-based systems that rely on remote rendering [26] or new web technologies [29], [38] can also allow people to carry out visualization tasks on the commodity devices they use regularly. These systems, however, often target data exploration tasks, whereas we focus on data communication with the support for collaborative annotation and storytelling.This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data stories,"SUBMISSION TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS 3 Also, our ﬁrst prototype provides storytelling techniques on top of visual outputs from exploratory visualization systems, so the V-Mail concept could be applied to visualization software built as standalone applications. 2.2 Annotating Spatial 3D Data When compared to creating data stories for 2D or non- spatial data, authoring stories about 3D spatial data includes another special consideration in that it requires connecting text, speech, drawings, or other input from authors to speciﬁc spatial views or data elements. These software features are often described as 3D annotations, which can be tied directly to data objects [37], [40]. Alternatively, graphical annotations can be drawn in ‘screen-space’ [3], [13], [25], [37]. Without the need to explicitly reference data elements, this ‘screen- space’ drawing with ‘free-form’ annotations enables users to be more expressive [13] and even to draw in ‘empty space,’ which can be useful in sparse 3D scenes [37]."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data storytelling,"After creating an annotation from one viewpoint, we add a snapshot of the annotated view to the scene as a 3D widget (view frustum with a textured ﬁlm plane) that can be seen from other vantage points and returned to later. 2.3 Arranging and Transitioning Between Multiple Views Many data storytelling systems provide multiple comple- mentary data views, and they are considered critical for 3D data storytelling [3], [36], [40]. One reason is that understanding the complex spatial relationships in 3D data often requires multiple and/or animated perspectives [20], [24], [28], [34]. By smoothly transitioning between these perspectives, well-designed animations can allow the audi- ence to build a congruent mental model of the spatial data [10]. Different mechanisms exist for authoring animations for data storytelling. These can be as simple as recording a sequence of interactions performed by the storyteller [40] or providing animation templates to assist users in creating a ﬁnal animation [3]. Authoring a meaningful animation, however, can be complicated. Automated techniques are thus also useful, especially in time-critical scenarios such as urgent care in a hospital [14] and even for science dissemination [21]."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data story,"As in the children’s picture book, it is possible to animate forward and backward through the data story, with different playback modes to control the time with precision or to quickly skip to a new chapter. With this approach, complex messages are broken down into more digestible, visual, and expressive forms (C3–C5). The V-Mail frameworks requires just three additional con- cepts to be added to this core “book metaphor” functionality: Floating 3D pages —When presenting visualization re- sults with a set of captured data views, we often think of a panel listing the views; e. g., thumbnails on the viewer in AniViz [3]. V-Mail includes such a panel, but in addition to this panel, the data views are also included directly within the spatial visualization of the underlying 3D data."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data story,"Together with the smooth transitions between the data views achieved with animations, these ﬂoating pages assist users in understand the spatial correspondences between views as they progress through a data story (C4). Living documents —To remove the one-way character of existing 3D data communication and turn the data communication into a collaborative and iterative process accessible to non-experts, V-Mail treats the data stories as living documents (C1, C6). The framework makes it possible for users to explore a V-Mail, provide annotations, and extend stories in a way that scales with the capabilities of the device being used. Communication via a lightweight token —To realize this device ﬂexibility (C2) and thus be able to engage a broad audience (C1), V-Mail does not rely on dedicated rendering support. Instead, stories are shared as a video URL—online token that can be interpreted based on the used device and the absence or presence of dedicated software."

However, this lowest level of ﬁdelity supports only simple viewing options (e.g., the web client in Table 1).

A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data story,"We chose this design to enable the user to ideate and draft a story before sharing it to others, similar to drafting an e-mail before sending it. 4.2.3 Viewing an animated data story As a sequence of data views with animated transitions, a V-Mail story is akin to a video with chapters. We thus borrow different playback modes from traditional video players and adjust them to our application (Fig. 6). As in normal video players, playback continues until the end of the story (top row in Fig. 6). However, different from normal videos, the V-Mail player pauses brieﬂy at each ‘chapter mark’ to devote additional time to and indicate the Data View #1 Data View #2 Data View #3Fig. 6."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data stories,"Finally, for faster navigation, the player also supports jumping between data views without animations (bottom row in Fig. 6).2Another aspect of data stories that is different from normal videos is that it can be useful to view data stories, especially the transitions between views, in reverse. Thus, all three of the play modes include support for reverse playback. To allow users to explore V-Mails in a more ﬁne-grained manner, similar to video players, we also provide a time- line slider (Fig. 2(d)). To emphasize the aspect of chapter transitions we constrain the timeline dragging to between two neighboring data views, so that it is easy for a user to focus on the visualization view while controlling the timeline with a mouse."
A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data story,"This constraint is reset on each mouse down (for exploring a new transition) and can be removed with a modiﬁer key. 4.2.4 Linking free exploration and storyboard timeline Again different from traditional video players, the interaction in a data story is not restricted to just playing back a pre- created video stream. Instead, a user may exploring the 3D data visualization freely, potentially to capture slightly different shots or to better understand a feature in the data. After such a free exploration (and if no new shot was added to a timeline), the viewer may want to transition back to the timeline. We support both of these types of transitions by keeping the 3D visualization view and the timeline exploration linked and use animation transitions from the set described in Section 4.1.3."

As a most basic representation we thus rely on a traditional video that we generate from the data story, just as if one would have used a normal playback to watch it. Any device that supports video ﬁle playback (we use MP4 ﬁles) can thus show this most basic V-Mail format—including virtually all mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. Devices or players that also support video subtitles embedded in video ﬁles can also show the textual comments. Similarly, we also embed chapter marks for those video players that support it."

In Fig. 1 we show photos of these solutions and in Table 1 we compare them by the features they support. As just described, our most basic web client relies on the video player available on virtually all connected devices (Fig. 8(c)) to facilitate passive storytelling [40].

As it is likely used on small-screen devices, the app does not support changing the chapter order, and instead of using thumbnails for the data views in the storyboard, the app places crumbs on the timeline to provide visual and navigational support to users. The mobile app facilitates a much richer form of col- laboration by means of data stories than the web client, including being able to directly comment within the viewing environment and some 3D exploration. However, since this functionality relies only on the built-in video playback avail- able in virtually all devices, the processing power required is essentially the same as the web client. Also, because it runs on mobile devices, it inherently allows people to engage with data stories like they do with other online media, for example, during a break, at home, or while traveling. In fact, the URL format makes it possible for people to share V-Mails on a variety of communication platforms, from e-mail to messaging apps, already installed on their phones. For full-ﬁdelity interaction, however, we created a desk- top V-Mail plugin to a data visualization application [17] for both Windows and MacOS. This setup provides the functionality described in Section 4.2."

The feature would also be required if V-Mail is used with other storytelling media, e. g., for providing interactive ﬁgures in a paper submission as discussed by the brain science team.

A31,V-Mail: 3D-Enabled Correspondence about Spatial Data on (Almost) All Your Devices,1,1,data storytelling,"We build upon existing spatial 3D data storytelling techniques that tightly couple storytelling with data exploration and employ semi- automatic procedures to expedite the story creation process. What is unique in V-Mail is the ability to collectively work on data stories, which is often seen with abstract data visualization, e. g., via web-based visualizations, but less so with visualization of spatial 3D data. Essentially this multi- author editing in V-Mail is a type of parallel storytelling, with the difference that users not only view or edit shared data stories but also do this across different devices. V-Mail is thus an example of using multiple display devices in collaborative data visualization [15], [16]. V-Mail focuses,however, on asynchronous remote communication and pro- vides lightweight mobile and web clients for partaking in collaboration and simpliﬁes the distribution process using URLs to reference data stories. The desktop-client is an example of asynchronous col- laboration frameworks that support collaborative activities around exploratory visualizations. The mobile-client, how- ever, supports these activities around video-based visualiza- tions created from the desktop-client. The ability to provide visual feedback directly onto shared visualization results is similar to the ability to annotate on shared data views and stories in the web-based visualization."

The comic strip narrative style is an eﬀective method for data-driven storytelling. However, surely it is not enough to just addsome speech bubbles and clipart to your PowerPoint slideshow to turn it into a data comic? In this paper, we investigate aspects of partition- ingand sequence as fundamental mechanisms for comic strip narration: chunking complex visuals into manageable pieces, and organizing them into a meaningful order, respectively. We do this by presenting resultsfrom a qualitative study designed to elicit diﬀerences in participant behavior when solving questions using a complex infographic compared to when the same visuals are organized into a data comic."

Below we review relevant prior art. 2.1 Visual Communication and Visualization Visualization is a particular form of visual language traditionally used for solitary sensemaking. The notion of communication-minded visualization (CMV) [ 29] builds on ideas from visual communication by noting that visualization can often be used for more than just individual insights.

Despite this, it is onlyrecently that data-driven storytelling was fully embraced by the visualization community, with a survey by Segel and Heer in 2010 [ 27], and successful work- shops at the annual conference in 2010 and 2011 [ 9,10]. Hullman and Diakopou- los followed this up by studying how framing, context, and design impact the rhetoric of a narrative [ 16]. Since then, several practical methods and techniques have been proposed, including using sketching for narration [ 23], story points in Tableau [ 22], and automatic spatialization for visual exploration [ 19]. Most recently, Hullman et al. [ 17] studied sequence in narrative visualization, propos- ing a graph-driven approach for transitioning between views to minimize loadon the viewer. 2.3 Comics for Visualization Recent eﬀorts have tried to harness comics for visualization. Jin and Szekely [ 20, 21] proposed a visual query environment that uses a comic-strip metaphor for presenting temporal patterns. However, their system solely uses comic strips forlayout, and does not leverage the full potential of comics for communication. The most recent and most relevant work in this vein is Graph Comics [ 2], which are data-driven comics used for telling stories about dynamic networks.More recently, Bach et al. [ 3] presented the generalized notion of data comics, but does not evaluate its partitioning and sequencing mechanisms."

The edges of thepanels represent the limits of representation within this smaller bit of the page layout, but each panel also contributes to the larger unit, leading to an inter- pretive experience that is both linear and holistic since each panel is interpretedindividually but also as part of the larger page. The gutters, while delineating the limits of each panel, also indicate the necessity for the reader to engage in closure in order to generate a more coherent narrative (Fig. 2b). While traditional comic creators typically work in a constructivist fashion, building scenes and sequences from the bottom up, a data comic may conceptu- ally be designed in more of a top-down fashion: starting with the data and itsmanifestations."

For the purpose of this work, we classify some of them as space-oriented (info- graphics, posters, annotated charts) and others as time-oriented (videos, slide-shows). Space-oriented genres present and com- municate through space: layout, size, visual and graphical elements organized on a canvas, equally and instantaneously accessible to the reader, leaving it to the reader which elements to watch, how long, and in which order. The time-oriented gen- res present and communicate linearly over time; they have an order with a ﬁxed beginning, a middle, and an end; a develop- ment over time, an argumentation and they can present change over time through animations [6]."

There is not a precise deﬁnition of what is or is not a data comic, rather data comics combine elements from different genres, presented in a unique visual and narrative framework. Bach et al. [10] describe four essential components that help discussing the uniqueness of data comics: the presence of data visualization; ﬂow, whether linear or non-linear; narration to include and illustrate contextual information and create a compelling narrative as opposed to a factual presentation of charts; and words-and-pictures combined visually using multiple strategies. The patterns presented in this work are most close to the dimensions of ﬂow andnarration."
A35,Design Patterns for Data Comics,1,1,data stories,"While we can ﬁnd many examples of data stories that include some elements of comics (juxtaposition, combination of text and image, etc), very few examples exist that combine these components into a fully ﬂedged data comic. Nature provides a high quality example on the challenges of climate change [44] in 2015 combining data visualization, narration, linear-and- non linear ﬂow, into a compelling, visually striking and even emotional piece. Cisneros created an interactive comic using Tableau Graphics [16]. Additional examples include a scien- tiﬁc report on the change of water temperatures [12] and graph comics [8]."
A35,Design Patterns for Data Comics,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"For data-driven storytelling, Bach et al. [11] describe general higher level narrative patterns for data-driven storytelling (e.g., addressing-the-audience, ex- ploration, or gradual reveal ), some of which were described as patterns that deﬁne the “ﬂow” of a story: exploration, gradual reveal, repetition, speed-up/slow-down. While none of these mentioned patterns are speciﬁc about the storytelling genre, the actual implementation of pattern depends on the genre and its media. Some of these patterns can be translated into narrative comic design patterns, as shown later. DATA COMICS USE CASES To obtain more examples of data comics and to explore design patterns, we created 11 data comics aiming for a diverse set of datasets and audiences."
A35,Design Patterns for Data Comics,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Data Comics for Data-Driven Storytelling From carrying out these explorations, it became clear that data comics provide something distinct from infographics and other techniques for communicating data. While there is a broad application of known patterns, there is also a ﬂexibility in the ways that material is treated and a rich reserve of structuring principles to draw on that aid understanding. In particular, formalizing common visual patterns in terms of comic lay- outs allowed us to identify some general strategies for visual storytelling and unexplored regions in this design space. The language of comics makes these patterns more explicit, fa- cilitating the creation of complex data visualizations."
A35,Design Patterns for Data Comics,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"We see data comics and the design patterns as an easy- accessible idea-creation space for data-driven storytelling and which can then be translated into other formats (genres). More- over, we hope that our data comic design patterns, by talking about the relations between content, will support the develop- ment of communication patterns that can inspire other genres and media that make use of time, ink, pixels, interactivity and space—digital/physical, 2D/3D—equally well. This may lead to new hybrid forms for storytelling, including interactive web- comics, wall-sized walk-though comics, as well as interactive presentations.

More specifically, do visual cues help deliver the intended message when the presentation includes a verbal narration of the visualization? In this paper, we first present an in-lab study with 4 visual- izations, 9 cueing conditions and 30 participants to examine whether visual cues improve the comprehension of the visual- ization and the recall of the cued material when people view visualizations accompanied by an audio narration. With the help of an eye-tracker, we also explore how various visual cues affect the eye gaze patterns of the viewers."
A36,Understanding Visual Cues in Visualizations Accompanied by Audio Narrations,1,1,narrative visualization,"Based on the results, we conclude with suggestions on choosing visual cues based on the role of the cue, the visual character- istics of the highlighted regions, and the chart type. 2 RELATED WORK We begin by discussing prior work on narrative visualization. Then, we provide an overview of research on the effectiveness of visual cues. Narrative Visualization Segel and Heer analyzed the design space of data visualiza- tions for storytelling and identified distinct genres, visual narrative tactics, and narrative structure tactics [ 24]. Their framework lists ""Highlighting"" as a visual narrative tactic category containing six tactics: close-ups, feature distinction, character direction, motion, audio, and zooming. In our work, we use visual cues as the feature distinction tactic and verbal narration as the audio component. Kosara focused on the setting and the audience of story- telling visualization presenting three storytelling scenarios for visualizations: self-running presentation, live presentation in front of an audience, and individual presentation of results [19]."
A36,Understanding Visual Cues in Visualizations Accompanied by Audio Narrations,1,1,narrative visualization,"While we also examine the effect of visual cues for narrative visualizations, our study broadens the scope of research by examining eight different types of cues and a combination of two different cues for visualizations with audio narratives. While several existing works have focused on the effective- ness of a single visual cue, others have evaluated combina- tions of visual cues [ 4,14]. Cole et al. studied the allocation of visual attention when using a combination of desaturation, transparency, depth of field, and contour. They found all cues are effective alone, but cues are most effective when com- bined [ 4]."
A36,Understanding Visual Cues in Visualizations Accompanied by Audio Narrations,1,1,narrative visualization,"However, given our focus on visual cues for narrative visualization, we selected a different set of visual cues as some of the visual cues used for Hoffman et al.’s study were not applicable (e.g., beam and splash). Instead, we use visual cues from Kong et al. [ 18] since their study also focused on visual cues for presentations. 3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We investigated our research questions by conducting two complementary studies.

A37,Comparing Effectiveness and Engagement of Data Comics and Infographics,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"ABSTRACT This paper compares the effectiveness of data comics and infographics for data-driven storytelling. While infograph- ics are widely used, comics are increasingly popular for ex- plaining complex and scientific concepts. However, empirical evidence comparing the effectiveness and engagement of in- fographics, comics and illustrated texts is still lacking. We report on the results of two complementary studies, one in a controlled setting and one in the wild."

It covers a multitude of formats to match the diversity of audiences, messages, contexts, data, and communication media [ 44]: magazine style, annotated charts, partitioned posters, flow- chart, comic strips, sideshows and videos. Many of these formats can be seen as complementary, in that they support specific media, might be more attractive to specific audiences, have different ways of supporting a specific message, and involve specific skills and tools for creation. CHI 2019 Paper    CHI 2019, May 4–9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK Paper 253 Page 1 In this paper, we are interested in data comics [3,54], a relatively new and underexplored format."
A37,Comparing Effectiveness and Engagement of Data Comics and Infographics,1,1,data storytelling,"Study materials for the Lab study, in the wild study, questions, some interview quotations and examples of reading sequence record, can be found online: http://datacomics.net.2 BACKGROUND This section overviews previous studies on illustrated texts, infographics and other related data storytelling media. Texts and Pictures Textual descriptions (printed and spoken words) and graphi- cal depictions (photography, drawings, paintings, maps and videos) are the basic forms of representation [ 43,51]. In- formation is remembered better when it is supported with pictures [ 28], even more so when presented through both channels at the same time [ 6,13,36,48]. Data visualizations have been found less memorable than natural scenes [ 11], yet adding embellishments and unique presentations can improve memorability [ 7,11]."
A37,Comparing Effectiveness and Engagement of Data Comics and Infographics,1,1,data stories,"Stories During the study, participants read three data stories, a num- ber we chose with respect to how long we expected partici- pants to remain attentive and remember story content. Our main criteria in finding appropriate stories for a controlled lab study were (i) comfortably presentable on A3 paper and (ii) requiring little previous knowledge. To extend the varia- tion among the study examples, we selected different types of common visualizations including multivariate data, dynamic networks, and geological distribution. To ensure realistic stories, we selected three existing infographics (see below)."
A37,Comparing Effectiveness and Engagement of Data Comics and Infographics,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Eventually, comparison with other formats for data-driven storytelling (videos, interactives, physicaliza- tions, etc. [ 27]) can yield more insights in the respective drawbacks and merits of each format. Better understanding of the potentials of data comics will lead to better authoring support and education. 8 CONCLUSION The new genre of data comics combines many features with the potential of making data-driven stories accessible and un- derstandable. In order to verify the comics’ effectiveness on reader’s understanding, memorability and engagement, we conducted two experiments comparing data comics with in- fographics and illustrated texts. Our results are encouraging 1http://ieeevis.org/year/2011/keynote/visweek/how-editing-and-design- changes-news-graphicsfor the use of data comics, especially for complex spatio- temporal data, which are naturally hard to visualize in info- graphics."

The first study asked eight educators to  make sense of students’ data, and the second was an in-the- wild study conducted with eight teams of students reflecting  on their own activity. Our findings show the potential of the prototypes to support reflection on team performance, stress  management, and errors made."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data storytelling,"Explanatory Visualisation and Data Storytelling  Explanatory visualisation is related to the emerging concept  of data storytelling (DS) that builds on classic InfoVis [34,  94, 97] and narrative storytelling foundations [50] . DS is an  information compression technique for communicating insights to an audience through the combination of data, visuals, and narrative [29, 76] . Data stories are commonly  crafted manually by an analyst (with exceptions discussed  in next section) who identifies insights from the data and  creates charts with enhancements (e.g. changes in size,  colour or saturation, and adding text and markers) highlighting only the data points that are most relevant to  make a claim in a consumable form [48]. Explanatory visualisation is also related to prescriptive  guidance [13, 80]. Providing guidance in visualisation  involves developing approaches to facilitate sensemaking,  with minimal knowledge required from casual users. Prescriptive guidance has been mostly tailored to support  data analysts to find insights from multidimensional  datasets [1, 89]."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"However, none of these works has been tested in authentic settings and only one [30] has considered the particularities of the learning  design for crafting data stories. Our work goes beyond this  work by 1) proposing an approach for dynamically generating explanatory MMLA tools that communicate insights based on the assessment criteria ; 2) investigating  the implications of educators and students using these  interfaces; and 3) illustrating the approach in two authentic deployments in the context of nursing team simulations. Multimodal Learning An alytics User Interfaces  MMLA is emerging as a promising, and increasingly affordable, way to capture and analyse human activity that until now, has remained ephemeral and invisible to computational analysis. Collocated teamwork in the classroom and the workplace is one such example [59]."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data storytelling,"The approach  The aim of the approach is two-fold i) categorising the  underlying multimodal data into meaningful layers of  information, and ii) a pplying data storytelling to drive  visual attention to key events of the learning activity. As a  starting point we use Echeverria ’s et al. [32] model for  adding meaning to multimodal data. This is shown in grey in Figure 2. Boxes represent artefacts such as data structures and interfaces."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"The LM  can be visualised as data stories (S) shown in a layered  explanatory interface, by operationalising DS principles. In  sum, the proposed approach expands Echeverria et al.’s by  1) modelling assessment criteria to enrich the data stream  and produce a learner model, and 2) adding components  related to DS. These contributions are now detailed. Multimodal modelling  Inspired by an educational data mining technique to encode sequences of logged interactions using alphabets [70],  Echeverria ’s et al. [32] proposed a modelling representation  termed the (m -by-n) multimodal matrix (M)."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data storytelling,"As we explain  below, the introduction of learner modelling and data storytelling enable us to overlay additional information to  guide interpretation and provide more insight. Learner modelling based on the assessment criteria  Although the multimodal matrix can be useful for mapping  from multimodal data to more meaningful information for  teachers and students , it is still not possible to generate  explanatory visualisations. What is missing is a model of  the learner to close the interpretative gap. LMs are  foundational to provide personalised and adapted support  through LA and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) [11, 18]."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data storytelling,"Data Storytelling principles . Ryan [76] and Knaflic [48] identified the following set of DS principles that underpin our approach:  DS1. DS is goal orie nted. The design of a data story should  be aligned with a specific goal. This enables the identification of the data that should be highlighted. DS2. The data story should rely on a fitting chart type . Some charts work better for certain purposes. For example,  line charts effectively show changes over time [76] . DS3."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data story,"The data story should be stripped down first. Aligned to Tufte’s data-ink ratio [94], clutter adds  complexity to visual interpretation. Decluttering can be  achieved by removing unnecessary headers, borders, grids and data points that do not add informative value. DS4."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data story,"The data story should guide attention. Visual and  narrative elements can be used to emphasise key data points  to create meaning. This can be achieved by 1) adding  enhancements such as arrows, lines, symbols or enclosures;  2) changing colour, contrast or thickness; and 3) annotating  salient data features or adding prescriptive titles that  summarise the message of the story. These DS principles will be illustrated through the layered  storytelling prototypes below."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data story,"Each layer should represent a particular view of the  learning activity, showing only one data story at a time  [42]. This can facilitate the communication of insights while minimising distraction [31] . L2. A static layer should be used as a shared frame."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data story,"Each data story in a layer should be contextualised to the characteristics of the learning activity, such as duration, participants and critical incidents. This can be achieved by keeping the static layer (faded) in the background and overlaying others on top. L3. The user should be able to select and combine layers."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data story,A layer presents a data story  that communicates a class of insights about team activity. Teachers and students should be able to flexibly select and combine different layers to facilitate sense making. L4. Data points highlighted in different layers should be  clearly distinguished.
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data story,"Each  data story should be aligned with the learning design [38] to  effectively provoke reflection on aspects that are relevant and that the teacher would normally provide feedback on. Next section shows how these principles and components of  our approach were materialised in two authentic studies. STUDIES   Two data storytelling prototypes (1 and 2) were created  based on the principles presented above. Each was tested  with educators and students in the context of Sims 1 and 2  respectively. This section describes both studies in terms of  participants, materials, methods and analysis. Participants  Eight educators (E1 -8, 1 male, 7 females) with extensive  experience in simulation training (7-20 years) participated  in Study 1 ."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data story,"Each layer appears on top of the timeline of  actions (Figure 3) to give context to each data story (DS2 ). The timeline is decluttered, and its opacity is reduced for  selecte d data points to appear emphasised (L4 and DS3). Examples in Figure 4 illustrates how a set of rules (in Table  1) were used to add visual enhancements according to the  pedagogical intentions. Principle DS4 was endorsed by  highlighting data points using symbols (A), arrows (B),  changes of colour/opacity (C) and enclosures (D)."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"Based on this, our studies  aimed at in vestigating: 1) the added value of making  multimodal data visible through data stories; 2) the anticipated in-classroom orchestration of the tools; and 3)  the potential impact on students ’ accountability . Inspired by  the growing interest on explainable AI [96] , we also sought  to understand 4) the implications of exposing the algorithms  used for crafting the stories. Study 1 was conducted as 45-minu tes individual interviews  with educators (E1-8) and Study 2 as 30-minutes focus  groups with students (S1-5) of each team (T1-8). This paper  focuses on the next four tasks both educators and students  were asked to do."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"Students also appreciated the evidence  provided by the data stories. A student stated: “ It’s not just  that we were late, but we were late by that much time . We  can precisely see how much we have to improve, and what  we have done well. It makes a big difference!” [T1, S2]."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"All but one  student was keen for other students to reflect on their data stories if it “ helps in their learning ” [T3, S1], especially if  “the teacher sits down with them and talks it through” [T4,  S2]. The only concerned student explained that “ others  would find it very boring because it doesn't relate to them ”  [T1, S2]. Surprisingly, none of the students raised concerns in sharing their arousal traces “ as long as it doesn’t include  [their] names ” [T5, S1]. However, some students  mentioned that if they knew before the sim that their data would be shown to others, it would affect their performance."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"In sum, prescriptive data stories can raise accountability and privacy concerns. However, educators and students suggested ways to address some of these through pedagogical strategies and interface design features. Algorithmic transparency and manipulability  All educators agreed that teachers and students should be  able to see the if-then rules, as an additional layer that could  be “turned on or off” [E2] as in our prototypes . Educators  considered that showing the rules during the debrief could help them guide the discussion by contrasting team’s  performance with the learning expectations."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"After understanding the rules, all students appreciated the importance of knowing how data stories were generated. One student explained that understanding the algorithm can be useful for reflection, as follows: “Looking at these rules is useful because it’s like if you ask  a question and someone says no, you’re like, well why is  that wrong? Like this is constructive feedback or whatever it’s called” [T7, S1]. However, although some students  mentioned that they would not mind seeing the rules, most agreed that they prefer to only reflect on the data stories (e.g. “Can’t you just incorporate the rules into each [layer]  instead of doing it in an extra layer? Like explaining: ‘this  is [highlighted] in orange because…’ ” [T8, S3]). In terms of the flexibility to change the rules , all educators  agreed that the rules should be defined by the teacher who coordinates the subject. For instance, E3 commented that  “a tutor may want five key things that matter the most in a  simulation, so there could be rules related to each of those  five things” , which reflects how Prototype 2 was design ed  matching the teacher’s assessment criteria items."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"In contrast, most students preferred to only interact with the consequences of the rules (the data stories) without needing to see the rules. DISCUSSION   In this section we summarise the key findings, share our critical reflections, connecting to the broader literature, and note the limitations of these studies. The potential of the layered storytelling approach  In Dewey’s [22] view, reflection involves the observation of the experience retrospectively to discern explanations for  what happened. We heard consistent ly positive responses  from educators and students , that the way in which data was  communicated provoked deeper reflection on simulation  experiences."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"In contrast to the current educational situation — in which debriefings are dependent on expert educator  observation (but often stretched over multiple teams), and the partial (sometimes stressed, and always biased) memories of students — they recognised the value of capturing objective evidence of collocated activity and  rendering it visible as data stories. Educators a lso envisaged  the use of this same evidence to review their instructional  designs . This is consistent with Lockyear et. al. [51]  proposal that analytics-enabled feedback should support  curriculum planning and redesign. Although the utility of some layers can be tied to particular  simulations (e.g. the time responsiveness layer is m ore  relevant in a CPR sim than in non-emergency situations), from an educational point of view, this is expected."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"Context specificity is precisely the rationale for  aligning the data stories with the educators’ desired learning outcomes . This can explain, for example, how a  short delay in performing an action may be a critical error in some cases (e.g. a resuscitation scenario) and not having much importance in others (e.g. in non-life threatening  situations). Each layer can thus be useful in a family of  learning situations that share similar pedagogical intentions. We illustrated this with the mistakes and arousal layers  which were instantiated differently in both studies."
A38,From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,1,1,data stories,"Although false negatives were  not identified in any of our prototypes, multimodal data stories can certainly introduce bias in the way annotations are written, how rules are created, and how accurat ely  sensors capture data. We concur with this more cautious view, since the validity and reliability required for automated grading is significantly beyond the current maturity of this infrastructure. We lower the stakes by focusing on formative feedback, to provoke deeper reflection and dialogue, in which the human agents determine the ultimate meaning and consequences. Human -centered design, and its tensions  The adoption of human-centered design is an obvious way  to address concerns such as the above [63] ."

Ger - shon and Page have argued techniques from the “ancient art of storytelling” can help users more effectively understand  complex data sources and their meaning [27] and researchers  have demonstrated how a variety of story forms can not only  support the effective understanding of data, but also make  engagement with it fun, fascinating, empathic and even scary  or challenging [8, 13, 31, 35, 51, 52]. The potential of data  storytelling is perhaps best illustrated by the success of data  journalism, where a range of high proﬁle examples (including  a Pulitzer Prize winner [40]) show how the coming together  of narrative techniques from journalism with data presentation  can entice and enable large public audiences to engage [52]. Video is underrepresented in data storytelling research, with  comparatively fewer projects exploring it than other forms [1,  3, 2, 32]. This is surprising because video has many properties  that could make it an extremely powerful means to bring data  to people in ways that they can, and will want to, consume. There are few types of story as approachable, illuminating  and entertaining as a professionally created video. Since the  ﬁrst moving pictures in the late 19th century, ﬁlmmakers have  developed a repertoire of structures, devices and techniques that guide audiences through complex, expansive and often contradictory evidence bases [69]."
A39,Brooke Leave Home: Designing a Personalized Film to Support Public Engagement with Open Data,1,1,data stories,"This means  data stories based on traditional videos are limited to featuring general data and interpretation, chosen with an entire audience  in mind. As a result, the level of individuality that can be  presented in terms of data choice and interpretation is limited  compared to many of the examples mentioned in the previous  section. We observe this might be particularly problematic in  the context of experiences for non-expert audiences, as previ- ous work has shown creating personal connections between data and things users care about can be effective in support-ing their engagement [42, 33, 30, 24, 37, 63, 22]. Moreover,  balancing explanation through narrative and the opportunity  to explore based on one’s personal perspective has been high- lighted as a key design principle of data storytelling [64] – a  balance videos identical to all viewers may not strike. Recent developments in responsive video technology, in par - ticular object-based media [4, 54], allow videos to be dynam- ically personalized based on data sources. As a result, it is  now technically possible to create videos featuring data and  interpretation personal to each viewer. While previous work  has speculatively argued that this might be used to help peo- ple understand data [32], existing empirical research has only  explored how a small subset of video’s features (e.g. visual  narrative, animation) can be employed to this end [3]."

A39,Brooke Leave Home: Designing a Personalized Film to Support Public Engagement with Open Data,1,1,data storytelling,"These ﬁndings highlight  potential issues of trust and representational complexity that  may arise as data videos seek to aid users in understanding data  and its implications by swapping free exploration for greater  levels of interpretation from a deﬁned authorial viewpoint –  a trade-off that has previously been observed across a range of other data storytelling forms [64]. We believe that – like  in traditional documentary ﬁlm, where the dialectic between  objective truth and representation is a well acknowledged  concern [14] – this challenge can be negotiated by reﬂective  and ethical practice by authors in respect to their intentions,  viewpoints and potential biases. However, we also believe  our ﬁndings show that negotiating such issues may prove especially complex for content that draws attention to being data-driven, in particular due to the well-established status of data as an objective thing in our society. For instance,  our ﬁndings suggest that design techniques that present data  prominently in the course of a video, like our Bank Balance  Indicator, can make a story feel more authentic and fact-based."

We study  how people adjust their attitudes toward (or away from) a  message experienced through a narrative visualization. In a  mixed-methods analysis, we investigate whether eliciting par - ticipants’ prior beliefs, and visualizing those beliefs alongside  actual data, can increase narrative persuasiveness. We ﬁnd that  incorporating priors does not signiﬁcantly affect attitudinal  change. However, participants who externalized their beliefs  expressed greater surprise at the data."

As defined by Munzner [ 36], animation in data visualization can carry three different meanings: it is (1) a transition between two dataset configurations, (2) a video- style playback that the viewers can control, and (3) a medium for data-driven storytelling. Based on the taxonomy proposed by Mun- zner, most prior research falls into the first two categories. For example, Thompson et al. [ 30] characterized animated transitions based on four dimensions (object, graphic, data, and timing) and proposed 10 transition types such as enter/exist, visual alteration, and data encoding alteration. Heer and Robertson [ 24] proposed that a properly designed animation can significantly improve the chance of accurate perception of the transitions between statistical charts."
A41,Communicating with Motion: A Design Space for Animated Visual Narratives in Data Videos,1,1,narrative visualization,"Consequently, we identified and categorizes animation techniques in data videos by narrative strategies such as emphasis and ellipsis. 1https://videoexplorer.idvxlab.com2.2 Narrative Visualization and Data Videos Narrative visualization, as an emerging form of storytelling, presents messages and arguments supported by data [ 41]. Being one of the common genres of narrative visualization, data videos integrate visualizations with animations, pictographic representations, and narrations [ 1,3] to support storytelling. In comparison with other genres such as magazine style and annotated chart [ 41], data videos are entirely author-driven and have a linear path of narration. Thus, the audience can easily follow the narration and consume morsels of high-value information in a short time. As annotated by Segel and Heer [ 41], narrative visualization can be viewed as the combination of narrative structures (strategies that organize plots or contents) and visual narratives (visual methods that shape narrative experience and communicate intended mes- sages). Prior research on data video has been focused on the analysis of its narrative structures. For example, Amini et al. [ 1] initiated a first step towards understanding data videos by analyzing the struc- ture of 50 data videos through the following narrative categories from cinematography: establisher, initial, peak, and release. As a subsequent effort, Amini et al. [ 3] analyzed the composition of over 70 data videos and proposed a taxonomy of elemental units in data videos."
A41,Communicating with Motion: A Design Space for Animated Visual Narratives in Data Videos,1,1,narrative visualization,"We are in particular interested in what animated techniques reoccurred across data videos and how they serve certain narrative strategies. 2.3 Techniques Augmenting Visual Narratives In narrative visualization, various techniques such as animation [ 41], interaction [ 43,45], and narration [ 32,42] can be used to augment visual narratives. For example, by examining 58 narrative visualiza- tions, Segel and Heer [ 41] identified three approaches to support- ing visual narratives, including visual structuring (e.g., a progress bar), highlighting (e.g., feature distinction), and transition guidance (e.g., animated transition). Hullman et al. [ 26] took a further look at story transitions by analyzing 42 narrative visualizations. They proposed six between-visualization transition types (e.g., dialogue, temporal, and causal) according to the logical relationships between frames. Such transitions can help build a smooth and meaningful story flow. Stolper et al. [ 45] analyzed 45 author-driven data stories and assigned storytelling techniques into four categories, including communicating narrative and explaining data, linking separated story elements, enhancing structure and navigation, and providing controlled exploration. Calliope designed by Shi et al. [ 42] can be used to automatically generate data stories using a sequence of expressive charts, accompanied by annotations and text narrations. Bach et al. [ 4] described a set of narrative design patterns such as ar- gument and flow for data-driven stories. Our work is influenced by techniques that augment visual narratives described above. Specif- ically, we focus on assisting visual narratives through animation design."

While this video is well-known for incorporating animation into visualization to engage the audience and sustain their attention [ 16, 39], its narrative strategies regarding capturing the excitement for data are also outstanding but under-explored. In the video, Rosling first decodes a scatterplot by presenting its two dimensions: income (x-axis) and lifespan (y-axis).

A41,Communicating with Motion: A Design Space for Animated Visual Narratives in Data Videos,1,1,narrative visualization,"To identifying narrative strategies, we conducted a literature review from cross-domain fields includ- ing narrative visualization [ 4,31], cinematic storytelling [ 12,47], narratology [ 7,49], and animation design [ 6,23]. After the litera- ture review, we extracted a set of key narrative strategies as code type candidates. For example, prior work suggested that Emphasis with motion can help convey critical information in a story [ 31] while Tension plays an important role in attracting the audience’s attention [ 12,47]. We then classified animation techniques into these narrative strategies by determining the object and intent of each animation technique in the context of the corresponding data video."

We found that the design space and its corresponding method cards can provide sev- eral benefits. First, the design space introduces novel animation techniques that can add diversity to the animation, “ the cards are lovely and ‘add a magnifier’ is a great visual metaphor that can focus viewers’ attention on specific data points ” (G01P01), “ it’s really cool that I’ve added ‘infinite zoom’ in my video, it makes the transition much smoother and I never thought of it in that way ” (G10P20)."

Two participants suggested that data videos can be a substitute for traditional data reports and serve as their new choice for business presentations; a well-designed data video can help tell an expressive story on business performance."

The nar- rative can either follow the linear order of story events (chronology),  or deviate from linearity (anachronies). While evidence exists that  anachronies in novels and flms can enhance story expressiveness,  little is known about how they can be incorporated into narrative  visualization.

The narratives of visualization  are comparable to the narratives of story forms such as novels and  flms, where a storyteller may present the story events in the order  they occurred linearly (i.e., chronology) or deviate from linearity  (i.e., anachronies [29]). Such manipulation of narrative linearity is  viewed as a basic element and fundamental skill of storytelling [31]  due to its ability to enhance engagement, create better user experi- ence, convey ideas, or persuade [6, 55, 63].

A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"We choose  to study time-oriented stories specifcally, given that such stories  are a prominent type of narrative visualization [25, 34] whose nar- rative order can be precisely identifed by examining the temporal  positions of the narrative points. CHI    ’21,    May    8–13,    2021,    Yokohama,    Japan    Lan,    et    al. The studies were carried out in three steps: First, we conducted  preliminary interviews with seven experts from data journalism to  understand the motivations and challenges of manipulating narra- tive linearity in time-oriented stories. Then, we manually collected  a corpus of 80 time-oriented stories from online sources."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"These results contribute to the knowl- edge around narrative visualization and introduce new solutions of  expressiveness to data-driven storytelling.  2    BACKGROUND    AND    RELATED    WORK     This section provides the background knowledge about narrative  linearity and related work in the visualization community, including  narrative visualization and time-oriented storytelling.  2.1    Narrative    Linearity    and    Anachronies     Every story has two orders: the natural order of the story (which  is always chronological) and the order in which it is narrated [ 29]. When told chronologically, a story’s narrative order is equal to  its natural order. When storytellers distort the events in the story  out of their linear order, the discrepancies between the two or- ders are called anachronies [6]. In literary narratives, for exam- ple, frequently adopted anachronies include retrograde (reverse  chronology), zigzag (alternating between the past and present),  analepsis (fashback), prolepsis (fashforward), syllepsis (grouped  or parallel time), and achrony (ambiguous time), as summarized by  narratologist Genette [29]."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"For example,  Hullman and Diakoplous [32] proposed a taxonomy of rhetori- cal techniques used in narrative visualization, such as provenance  rhetoric and linguistic-based rhetoric. McKenna et al. [44] identi- fed seven fow-factors that shape data story reading experiences,  such as level of control, story progression, and navigation feed- back. Amini et al. [4] studied the narrative structure of 50 data  videos by decomposing the videos into initial, establisher, peak,  and release, inspired by cinematography. Hullman et al. [33] exam- ined sequential ordering in narrative visualization and identifed  six types of between-visualization transitions, including dialogue,  temporal, causal, granularity, comparison, and spatial transitions. They also found that global constraints such as parallelism help  make a narrative structure more efective. While the above research has shed light on understanding narra- tive techniques and structures, narrative linearity, as an indispens- able part of narrative visualization, is under-explored. This work,  to the best of our knowledge, is the frst to conduct a systematic  investigation of narrative linearity in time-oriented stories. We  hope this work will inspire the design and development of future  tools for creating expressive narrative visualization.  2.3    Time-Oriented    Storytelling     Time-oriented stories use temporal data to present changes, ar- guments, or ideas [3, 14, 62]. Time is a central thread that ties  everything together in the human history of visual storytelling,  starting from caveman paintings and Egyptian hieroglyphs to pic- ture books and comic strips [3]. For data visualization, change over  time is among the seven main types of data-driven stories [25,  34] and has been examined by many researchers. For example,  Brehmer et al. [ 14] proposed a design space for timelines that high- lights design expressiveness."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"To gather time-oriented stories of high qual- ity, we started by searching for the corpora collected by previous  studies about narrative visualization [4, 33]. Then, we referred to  well-known news media (e.g., The Economist, BBC), organizations  (e.g., Nature, NASA), and events (e.g., TED talks) to fnd additional  samples. We also searched keywords such as “timeline”, “history vi- sualization”, “trend visualization” on Youtube.com and Vimeo.com to collect stories from popular channels. In accordance with [ 4], a  story was identifed as qualifed if it met three criteria: (i) it presents  messages or arguments mainly supported by temporal data; (ii) it  includes at least one data visualization; and (iii) it follows a non- ambiguous narrative sequence (e.g., with self-running playback,  “Next” or “Continue” buttons, or a linear scroll path)."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"Last, by analyzing the grid data, we found  that while patterns such as chronology were controversial in ex- pressiveness, some nonlinear patterns were thought to be both  comprehensive and expressive, thus confrming H3.  6    DISCUSSION     This section discusses the implications and opportunities arising  from our study as well as limitations and future work.  6.1    Expressive    Narrative    Visualization     As early as narrative visualization was proposed, Segal and Heer [60]  discussed user experience as a promising future research direction. Lan, et al. But so far, we still know little about what people expect from data- driven storytelling and how to improve narrative expressiveness. This work tackles the what problem by conducting in-depth stud- ies with both professional storytellers and the general audience  to understand their needs."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,data stories,"Their responses are quite consistent:  people look for expressive data stories except for comprehensible  data facts. They want the data narratives to be eloquent, emotion- laden, efcient, memorable, and novel. However, to assess these  aspects, traditional measurements (e.g., accuracy and speed) are  insufcient [58] and may overlook much useful information about  user experience. Therefore, we claim that more user-centered mea- surements that respond to user experience should be incorporated  into the evaluation of narrative visualization. As for the how problem, we prove that for time-oriented stories,  manipulating narrative linearity can help restructure the story,  take the audience on varied journeys, and open up possibilities  for expressive storytelling. In line with our initial supposition, the  narrative orders used in data stories are more concise and less  artistic than those in flms or novels [29, 36]. The six narrative order  patterns we identifed more or less follow the chronological telling  order and use little reverse chronology. However, we are excited  to fnd that even a slight deviation from linearity (e.g., trace-back,  trailer) can bring about diferent experiences to the audience and  refresh the narratives. This result is also in line with the previous  fnding that human brains tend to prefer linear narratives, but can  be engaged by a certain amount of disruption [22]."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"We believe this  work is a step towards incorporating more storytelling elements  from psychology, literature, and cinematography into expressive  narrative visualization.  6.2    Layered    Narrative    Orders     While coding the corpus, we found that several samples had more  nested and layered narrative orders than the six patterns we iden- tifed. For example, A network of science: 150 years of Nature pa- pers [50] introduces the science paper network using trace-back as  its grounded narrative order: starting from the present network,  then going back to the beginning and continuing chronologically. However, when explaining the network evolution chronologically,  the video fashbacks and fashforwards several times to show how  the clusters of physics, biology, and genetics evolved respectively  during certain periods. In this story, the intermediate winds in the  narrative order are caused by hierarchical data (i.e., science and  its sub-domains)."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"Given such story tem- plates, storytellers can create various stories more easily by feshing  them out, thus opening up great potential for generating expressive  narrative visualization automatically or semi-automatically. This study about anachronies also leads us to rethink stories’  transformation cost, a concept describing narrative sequence efec- tiveness proposed by Hullman et al. [33]. According to [33], trans- formation cost is the total number of changes required to transform  the state of visualization to another, and it should be minimized. So, for a time-oriented story, the most efective narrative sequence  should be chronology."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"Thus, we claim that future tools for narrative visualization should  generate narrative sequences by taking story expressiveness into  consideration. For example, the algorithm may be able to compute  the possible climax or the tension underlying the data or enable  users to appoint their communicative intent or desired amount of  non-linearity [20], thus recommending optimal narrative orders.  6.4    Limitations    and    Future    Work     Our analysis of the six narrative order patterns is based on a man- ually collected corpus of 80 time-oriented stories, which were in- tentionally diverse but are by no means exhaustive. Future studies  can expand our corpus and examine additional samples targeted  at a specifc audience or industry. Second, due to the nature of  controlled experiments, the factors we could investigate in the  crowdsourcing study were limited."
A42,Understanding Narrative Linearity for Telling Expressive Time-Oriented Stories,1,1,data stories,"To generalize our fndings, future work could examine  more data visualization types such as line charts and stream graphs  as well as more data stories crafted based on various datasets, topics,  and have diferent cognitive complexity. We view this work as an initial step towards understanding the  narrative linearity in time-oriented stories. To further take advan- tage of the power of ordering narratives, future research may look  into more aspects such as how the narrative orders are nested and  how to choose the best narrative order for a given dataset. Another  interesting fact we found in our corpus is that when there is audio  narration, most storytellers tend to use anachronies rather than  chronological narratives."

A43,Leveraging Text-Chart Links to Support Authoring of Data-Driven Articles with VizFlow,1,1,narrative visualization,"Also known as “textual  narratives” [50] and “magazine style narrative visualizations” [41],  we defne data-driven articles as visual data stories [31] that feature  primarily textual narratives, containing claims and insights backed  by data and illustrated with data visualizations. While traditionally  static, these articles have become increasingly interactive over the  years as communicators experimented with a variety of storytelling  genres and narrative patterns such as infographics [46], interactive  slide shows [41], and data videos [2] to help readers understand  data [3, 33, 41, 50]. Scrollytelling [42, 43] is one such emerging approach where dy- namic updates to the article content are triggered by scrolling;  notable examples include the New York Times article called “Snow  Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek""1 (which is attributed as a pi- oneer of the genre [42]) and the popular educational article “A  visual introduction to machine learning""2. A key design idea in these  dynamic data-driven articles is connecting portions of the text  body to corroborating chart components using visual cues, such  as highlighting and animations."
A43,Leveraging Text-Chart Links to Support Authoring of Data-Driven Articles with VizFlow,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"We build on  the key notion of text and chart connections, or text-chart links, to  separate content from presentation (i.e., chart interventions and  storytelling layouts) and enable a more modular and extensible  approach to authoring of data-driven storytelling. The separation  between semantics and presentation has been proposed in a visu- alization authoring context [37] and the notion of text-chart links  has been applied to data-driven articles to some extent [14, 35, 57],  but they have yet to be explored in the context of authoring and  controlling presentation aspects of data-driven articles. To help inform this authoring experience, we conducted inter- views with 6 authors from major media outlets (§3.1). Their feed- back refected an increasing readership on mobile platforms and a  desire for less exploratory and more guided approaches, leading us  1https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html  2http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/ to shift focus to scrollytelling stories."
A43,Leveraging Text-Chart Links to Support Authoring of Data-Driven Articles with VizFlow,1,1,data stories,"Our contributions include: (1) design directions for the author- ing of dynamic data-driven articles, based on an assessment of  scrollytelling articles and author feedback; (2) VizFlow , a prototype  system and test bed for the use of text-chart links to guide diferent  storytelling layouts; (3) evaluations of VizFlow with authors and  readers, demonstrating the utility, expressiveness, and efectiveness  of our approach, which helped inform (4) a set of lessons learned as  additional design recommendations for future authoring systems.  2 RELATED WORK  Terms like “data stories” and “data-driven stories” have been broadly  used to refer to journalistic pieces based on data analysis [48], which  may or may not include graphical components. In visualization re- search, Lee et al. [31] defne “visual data stories” as including a set  of story pieces “backed up by data” where pieces are “visualized  to support an intended message” and “presented in a meaningful  order”. Within that, we defne data-driven articles as visual data sto- ries that are primarily guided by text and supported by visualizations. Terms like “magazine style” [41], and “textual narratives” [50] have  also been used for stories featuring “visualizations embedded in  narrative text” [53]; in contrast, our scope also entails more analyt- ical data-rich documents [4] (e.g., data analysis reports) that might  not have an inherent narrative structure but are still data-driven. Following, we review past work on authoring and reading of  data-driven articles."
A43,Leveraging Text-Chart Links to Support Authoring of Data-Driven Articles with VizFlow,1,1,narrative visualization,"Ellipsis [37] and Chen et al.’s story synthe- sis framework [10] feature text annotations as an integral part of  their design, but are tailored towards narrative visualizations and  not data-driven articles. Finally, authoring tools like Tableau Sto- ries [51] and GeoTime [14] do support the creation of data-driven  articles, but ofer little freedom in the presentation aspects. Most tools to customize presentation of data-driven articles re- quire some scripting knowledge. Idyll [12] is a markup language for  web-based data stories, including interactive widgets and a num- ber of interactive scrollytelling layouts for text and visuals. Latif  et al. [29] also proposed a markup-based framework to connect  text and visualizations, which was applied to graph data and node- link based visualizations [30]. No-programming tools like Adobe  Spark [ 1] and others [ 15, 45, 47] support content creation with in- teractive storytelling for the web, but are mostly limited to images  and videos and are not designed with data visualization in mind. To our knowledge, our work is the frst to ofer a no-programming  solution to the authoring of dynamic data-driven articles.  2.2 From visual storytelling to scrollytelling  Eforts in visual storytelling have often turned to online articles  to help inform the design space of visual data stories [33, 41, 50]. Segel and Heer [41] reviewed 58 articles and proposed 7 genres  of narrative visualizations, including magazine-style narrative vi- sualizations, but also a variety of reader-driven genres that allow  exploratory freedom. Online articles have since gravitated towards  more guided and author-driven storytelling forms. Tse [55] reports  how this shift took place in the New York Times as they found the  majority of readers did not engage with interactive segments and  “just want to scroll"", thus leading to recommendations to trigger  dynamic changes (e.g., animations and transitions) based on scroll. This scroll-based storytelling format, aptly called scrollytelling,  has seen increased interest and uptake in recent years [42, 43]."
A43,Leveraging Text-Chart Links to Support Authoring of Data-Driven Articles with VizFlow,1,1,data stories,"Commu- nicators acknowledged its value for lowering barriers to create  “scrollers” , which are “annoying to do manually” (C1), that it can  be particularly useful to novices (C3, C5) such as “editorial re- porters [because] you don’t need a developer” (C3) as well as a quick  prototyping tool for data stories : “there’s always a question of  what would this look like as a scrollyteller (...) And this lets you answer  that question very quickly” (C1). A researcher in visual storytelling  liked that VizFlow was “focused on really storytelling” (S7) instead  of just visualization authoring, and that it was “very needed” (S7). As for the limitations, some participants missed more fne  grained control over the presentation , e.g., layout customiza- tions (S4) and better control of pacing with spacing between sec- tions (S2), to a lack of more exploratory modes of interaction, e.g.,  ID Title Source # Words # Charts  Art-A What Happened to America’s Political Center of Gravity?

A44,IGScript: An Interaction Grammar for Scientific Data Presentation,1,1,data story,"How- ever, few approaches focus on the stages of interactive data pre- sentations or data story building. We further narrow down the definition of data presentation in this paper to be a series of con- trols over virtual cameras. Thus the term “data presentation” in this paper consists of three aspects: (a) defining what important data feature the cameras can see; (b) changing cameras’ viewpoints to view data from different perspectives and scales; (c) selecting important viewports to present data. Building data stories and maintaining precise expressions on the presentations are important because of the following reasons. First, achieving precise control when generating gentle and elegant tran- sitions is difficult for people in human-computer interactions. For CHI ’21, May 8–13, 2021, Yokohama, Japan Richen Liu, et al. example, rotating the Earth manually by 10 longitudes per second evenly to generate a data story through recording a demo video for a science talk is highly impossible in a global map-based data visualization. A slight transition in shot changes between regions of interest (ROIs), similar to the style in film photography, is also difficult to achieve. Second, it often takes a long time in trial-and- error explorations which are of little use to get significant cases when generating a scientific storytelling demo through traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Third, supporting some complex application-specific presentations by using traditional GUI inter- faces is challenging."

Few external grammar ap- proaches aim to solve visualization problems toward complex plat- form development due to its independence on existing GPLs [ 38]. They need to build their own lexical analyzer and semantic ana- lyzer [ 50]. However, external interpretive grammars allow design freedom [ 11,48]."
A44,IGScript: An Interaction Grammar for Scientific Data Presentation,1,1,data story,"The design details consist of the designs of a light-weight compiler, a linked dual-space view, general-purpose grammars and application-specific grammars. 3.1 Design Goals and Considerations The design goals of IGScript are listed as follows: •G1: help users define ROIs via coarse-grained and fine-grained interactions •G2: form a presentation animation by recording visual tra- versals or visual tracking across ROIs •G3: enable users to edit the animation clips of a data story in a semantic space First, the ROIs can be defined through a multi-scale strategy, i.e., in a coarse-grained scale and a fine-grained scale (G1). We design a dual-space view, i.e., a visualization space view and a coding space view, to provide visual steering and visual feedback for ROI definitions. Users are allowed to place and move an ROI box in the visualization space by coarse-grained tuning and then adjust its position slightly (fine-grained) in the coding space. Second, the presentation animations are significant for domain experts to conduct domain experts’ discussion, which can be recorded by visual traversals or visual tracking across ROIs (G2)."
A44,IGScript: An Interaction Grammar for Scientific Data Presentation,1,1,data story,"The current version of IGScript covers data story cases on the  four frequently-used general data types in scientific visualization. It  can be easily adapted to other use cases for these types of data. As  for a new data type, APIs on data loading and application-specific  presentations (if any) should be added to the IGScript’s library,  while the general-purpose presentations are directly supported. The  coverage of the general-purpose presentations of IGScript includes  ROI definition (G1) and viewpoint changing (G2)."
A44,IGScript: An Interaction Grammar for Scientific Data Presentation,1,1,data story,"In this scenario, IGScript would trans- late the interactive data story generation steps into script codes, which would replace the visualized result data (e.g., image data or sub-volume data) in data transmission. This technique would alleviate the burden on real-time data exchange among VR devices to a large extent. Finally, we aim to support more general types of scientific data. 7 CONCLUSIONS Most existing interpretive grammar-based scientific visualization approaches enhance the customizability in either the computation stage, or the rendering stage, or both. However, few approaches focus on the data presentation stage."

However, limited attention has been paid to negative emotions specifically. This work investigates the outcomes of negative emotions in the context of serious data stories and ex- amines how they can be augmented by design methods from the perspectives of both storytellers and viewers. First, we conducted a workshop with 9 data story experts to understand the possible benefits of eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories and 19 potential design methods that contribute to negative emotions. Based on the findings from the workshop, we then conducted a lab study with 35 participants to explore the outcomes of eliciting negative emotions as well as the effectiveness of the design meth- ods. The results indicated that negative emotions mainly facilitated contemplative experiences and long-term memory. Besides, the de- sign methods showed varied effectiveness in augmenting negative emotions and being recalled."

Among various communication intentions, serious data storytelling is a common goal pursued by storytellers. Unlike stories that aim to entertain the audience [ 103, 113], serious data stories are based on serious topics (e.g., well-being and environment) whose messages to be communicated are often negative (e.g., inequality and pollution) [ 64]. Therefore, these stories often seek to elicit negative emotions such as sadness and fear from viewers [ 5,59]. Besides, there is a growing agreement that negative emotions can be useful in triggering reflective thoughts and long- lasting memory, or lead to a richer storytelling experience [ 9,14, 47,71]. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many data journalists discussed how to communicate negativity emotionally to viewers, in order to fight against the fatigue with data (feeling bored and numb with numbers) and make people aware of the tragedy and care about their own health [ 34,37,48].Iraq’s bloody toll(Fig. 1) deliberately uses a “bloody” bar chart to create a striking visual and connect viewers with the horrible war [93]."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"In the visualization community, there is also an increasing in- terest in people’s emotional experiences with data stories [ 92,113]. Researchers have attempted to understand the spectrum of emo- tions in data stories or explore certain types of emotions. For ex- ample, Bartram et al. [ 6] proposed 8 color palettes that convey emotions such as playfulness and disturbingness. Lan et al. [ 59] identified 12 typical emotional responses to infographics, such as happiness and sadness. Boy et al. [ 16] examined whether the use of anthropographics can enhance viewers’ empathy towards hu- man rights-related stories and increase the willingness to donate."

The above work has sug- gested that both positive and negative emotions can be triggered by data stories. However, more efforts have been put into studying emotions such as fun and empathy while the value of negative emotions is less recognized nor explored systematically.

To tackle these problems, we conducted two studies, one with storytellers and the other with viewers."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data story,"First, we conducted a work- shop with 9 data story experts. From the workshop, we collected a corpus of 72 serious data stories that communicate negativity and identified 3 possible benefits of eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories, as well as 19 potential design methods that the experts thought may augment negative emotions. The second study investigated viewers’ perceptions on the possible benefits of negative emotions as well as the effectiveness of the 19 design methods. Specifically, we used 13 stories from the corpus as the stimuli and conducted a lab study with 35 participants. The re- sults showed that negative emotions were significantly related to contemplative experiences such as reflective thinking and made a long-term impression on the participants."

For example, sad music can be attractive and engaging [ 51], and horror films can lead to enjoyment and gratification [ 118]. The notable literature, from ancient Greek theatre to the masterpieces of Shakespeare,comprises mostly tragedies. Since negative emotions function posi- tively in these circumstances, researchers have coined terms such aspositive negative experience [71],tragic entertainment [8], and valance transformation [94] to describe such emotional experiences."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"Data stories, as the combination of multimedia elements such as graphics, interaction, and music, have many shared features with the media discussed above. Therefore, in this work, we take serious data stories as an example and investigate them through the lens of negative emotions. 2.2 Serious Data Stories Data stories combine data visualization with narratives, interac- tion, embellishment, or animation to communicate data and in- sights [ 55,62]. Data stories are created for various purposes. In casual contexts, data stories are often created to entertain peo- ple [103,113] or boost web traffic [ 61]. Alternatively, storytellers may look beyond entertainment and use data stories to commu- nicate serious issues such as poverty, social injustice, and pollu- tion, and such practice is called serious storytelling [ 64]. Accord- ing to the corpora collected by previous studies about data sto- ries [ 2,45,96,98–100,117], a considerable proportion of the data stories in the wild are serious data stories. Besides, many win- ners of data storytelling awards (e.g., the Information is Beautiful Awards [ 49], the Sigma Awards [ 105]) are serious data stories. Given their wide application, researchers have studied serious data stories from various aspects. For example, Pandey et al. [ 76] used stories about taxing, incarceration, and violence to examine how data visu- alization helps persuade attitude changes. Heyer et al. [ 43] studied how the elicitation of prior beliefs affects the persuasiveness of serious data stories about drug overdose. Kong et al. [ 54] found that the phrasing of titles may induce bias in serious data storytelling (e.g., refugee problem). In addition, some researchers [ 16,72] have found that using anthropomorphized visualization in serious data stories (e.g., poverty, the migrant crisis) did not promote prosocial behavior significantly. However, we notice that limited work has been done to under- stand serious data stories from the perspective of negative emotions. Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories CHI ’22, April 29-May 5, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA Thus, this work explores how to facilitate serious data storytelling by leveraging negative emotions. 2.3 Emotion in Data Stories As data stories are increasingly used to communicate with a broad audience, investigating people’s emotions towards data stories is emerging as a research trend [ 59,92]. For example, Figueiras [ 33] stated that a key benefit of data storytelling is to create an emotional connection between the data and the audience. When evaluating data stories, many researchers agree that emotion is key to user engagement and should be taken into consideration [ 46,52,58,60, 113]. So far, existing research has studied the elicitation of emotion in data stories from various aspects, such as visual design and interaction. For example, Bartram et al. [ 6] and Anderson et al. [ 3] explored how color palettes help express emotions. Boy et al. [16] found that human-shaped pictograms in data stories about human rights have limited contribution to evoking empathy from viewers, which was recently reconfirmed by Morais et al. [ 72]. Lan et al. [ 59] studied 976 infographics and found that both the usability and expressiveness of graphic design can lead to emotions such as happiness and shock. Diakopoulos et al. [ 31] investigated how to make data playable through game-like interaction. While emotions such as fun and empathy have been frequently explored, the value of negative emotions is less recognized nor researched."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"Thus, we still lack knowledge about the role of negative emotions in data stories and how to leverage their benefits. To fill this gap, this work aims to investigate negative emotions in the context of serious data storytelling and explore how to design for such emotions. 3 WORKSHOP WITH STORYTELLERS This section aims to address our research questions from the per- spective of storytellers. Our main goal was to understand story- tellers’ motivations for eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories, how they communicate such emotions using design, and the pitfalls of such practice. Therefore, we conducted a workshop in this section and posed three questions to guide our research: (i) the possible benefits of eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories, (ii) the potential design methods that contribute to negative emotions, and (iii) the controversial issues concerning eliciting negative emotions. 3.1 Method To explore the above research questions, we conducted a workshop with 9 data story experts. We chose this method since it is effective in identifying needs, collecting in-depth opinions, facilitating idea exchanges, and generating design solutions collaboratively and efficiently [24, 35, 53, 63, 69]. 3.1.1 Participants. To recruit participants for the workshop, we published an invitation poster on social media platforms. In the poster, we introduced the theme of the workshop and informed that we were looking for participants who had more than 3 years experience in creating data stories. When selecting the participants, we referred to the guidelines for qualitative research [ 56,63]. For example, to facilitate effective discussion and in-depth collabora- tion, the number of participants should be controlled (typically lessthan 12) and their backgrounds should be diverse. To create an envi- ronment for the participants to speak and share, power differentials among the participants should be avoided."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data story,"With these issues in mind, we finally recruited 9 data story experts (6 female) with no power differential and have diverse backgrounds (more details can be seen in Table. 1).

Inspired by [ 63], the workshop consisted of two stages: the pre-workshop stage and the workshop stage. The pre- workshop stage was placed one week before the workshop stage, in which we introduced the theme of the workshop (i.e., negative emotions in serious data stories) to the experts and asked them to prepare a 10 to 15-minute case-sharing presentation around the theme of the workshop, that is, to share serious data stories they thought elicit negative emotions effectively and explain which de- sign methods augment the negative emotions. To help the experts better understand this task, we presented them with 5 example stories that are regarded by visualization researchers and profes- sional practitioners as successful examples of eliciting negative emotions [ 5,21,29,59], including Gun Death in the U.S. [83],the Fallen of World War II [41],Iraq’s bloody toll [93],One LGBT+ person is killed every day in Brazil [30], and Do you know who’s watching you? [116]. To collect as varied data stories as possible during the workshop, we also encouraged the experts to register the data stories they would like to present in a shared folder before the workshop to avoid the presentation of the same cases. In the second stage, we conducted the workshop online with the 9 experts via video meeting software. In the opening session, we gave a 10-minute introduction to the workshop and used one ice-breaking game to make the experts more familiar with each other. In the second session, the experts presented the serious data stories they had found to elicit negative emotions one by one and explained what design methods contribute to arousing negative emotions."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data story,"The first author led the focus group with a set of prepared questions, which were crafted following the methodology in [ 56,57], including 1 opening question that worked to warm up the discussion and guide the experts to recall the shared cases (i.e., “Which data story impressed you most?”), 1 introductory question to foster interaction among the experts and transit the focus to our research questions (i.e., “Do you think it is necessary to elicit negative emotions for serious data stories?”), and 3 key questions (“Why do you think these stories intend to elicit negative emotions from viewers?”, “What design methods do you think contribute to eliciting the negative emotions?”, and “What are the possible pitfalls of using such methods?”). During the discussion around these issues, we asked follow-up questions if we wanted the experts to clarify their opinions. This session lasted about 1.5 hours. The whole workshop lasted about 4 hours and was audio-recorded. 3.2 Results Together with the 5 example data stories, we collected a corpus of 72 serious data stories that the experts thought trigger negative emotions. These stories were created by notable news agencies such as Reuters and The New York Times, as well as individuals. The topics of the stories are also diverse (e.g., wealth inequality, health, education). Among these stories, 62 are web pages, 8 are infographics, and 2 are data videos."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"We identified 3 possible benefits of eliciting nega- tive emotions for serious data stories. B1: Lead to contemplative experiences. Seven experts (E1, E2, E3, E5, E7, E8, E9) stated that eliciting negative emotions for serious data stories is meant to trigger contemplative experiences, namely, making the viewers think and reflect [ 7]. For example, E7 said that “negative emotions may spark people’s willingness to discuss serious issues and finally deal with them. ” E8 agreed that “ negative emotions can push you to think and act. ” E3 complemented that “ we journalistsnot only create ‘stories you want to know’, but also ‘stories you should know’. Serious data stories are often the latter type. Such stories may be disturbing to look at, but they will guide you to reflect on yourself and society. ” B2: Enhance user engagement. Four experts (E1, E2, E4, E6) men- tioned that negative emotions can serve as a device for attracting attention and interest to read serious content. For example, E6 said that “ creating a negative atmosphere is a good way to grab atten- tion.” E1 complemented that “ since the public can easily get bored by statistics, emotional design is used to interest people in consuming serious data. ” B3: Leave a long-term impression."

Image sources: [13, 20, 27, 39, 66, 68, 73, 77, 78, 84, 86–90, 102, 106, 107, 116]. viewers to negative scenes (e.g., Fig. 2-10 [ 39]). The last design method is the metaphor with negative semantics , which inte- grates negative imagery with data visualization but “ in a more implicit way, trying to trigger synesthesia among the audience ”(E3). An example is Fig. 2-11 [ 89], which creates a bar chart using the metaphor of dripping oil."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"To achieve this goal, in serious data stories, designers can intentionally set a tough task for the viewers and make them struggle. For example, Fig. 2-19 [ 84] is a game that presents the names of African countries randomly to viewers and asks them to select the locations of these countries on the map. “ It is likely that people will fail again and again. By experiencing frustration or embarrassment, they will understand they do not know Africa at all ” (E3). 3.2.3 Controversies. We identified 3 controversial issues about eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories. C1: The acceptance level of negative emotions. Four experts (E2, E4, E6, E8) expressed their worry that negative emotions may not be enjoyed by everyone. “ The viewers may not continue reading if the story is negative ”, said E4. E2 complemented that “ sometimes we have to lower the negative degree of the design when dealing with topics like violence and suicide, in case the story becomes too uneasy to look at. ” E8 added that “ serious data stories should neither be too positive nor too negative, and we need to achieve a balance between the two states .” C2: The effectiveness of design methods. The experts debated the effectiveness of several design methods in eliciting negative emotions. For example, E2 and E1 had opposing attitudes towards CHI ’22, April 29-May 5, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA Lan, et al. the use of unit visualization . While E1 thought that “ showing people a large number of dots representing deaths can be striking ”, E2 said that “ a large number of dots is not more touching than a single vivid story ”."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data storytelling,"E4 referred to several game-playing cases mentioned in the workshop and questioned their ability to elicit negative emotions, and E8 agreed that it was still unclear how gamification can facili- tate serious data storytelling. E9 expressed her worry about using metaphor in data visualization: “ visual metaphor usually uses an artistic expression which is more implicit and may require higher visual literacy. ” C3: The self-expression of storytellers. Four experts (E1, E2, E4, E7) discussed whether it is acceptable for storytellers to express their own negative emotions in serious data stories. E1, an expert who works for a traditional news agency, said that “ the news re- porting ethics command us to be as objective as possible and avoid integrating our own emotions into stories. ” However, in commercial companies, expressing emotions seems to be more tolerable: “ design methods such as using an angry title is acceptable in my company since emotional content attracts people better ”(E2). E7 also supported the inclusion of subjective expressions. She mentioned the idea of data feminism [32] and argued that “ data is often thought of as ra- tional and objective, sort of masculine, but data can also be feminine, which is full of emotions. ” E9 said, “ We can have our own attitudes and emotions, but we have to communicate them appropriately."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"You can express emotions but should not incite emotions. ” 4 LAB STUDY WITH VIEWERS Based on the findings from the workshop, this section aims to ex- amine the communication of negative emotions in serious data stories from viewers’ perspective, including (i) what are the out- comes of eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories, and (ii) how effective are the identified design methods in augment- ing negative emotions. The study materials can be accessed at https://osf.io/c6vnu/. 4.1 Method Previous studies about the negative emotions triggered by media were mostly conducted in an exploratory or ethnographic manner, such as asking participants to recall and describe their negative experiences [ 14,15] and conducting laboratory observations and interviews [ 36,47,70]. The advantage of such a method is that the participants are presented with stimuli from the real world so they can read or interact with the stimuli as they are in their everyday lives rather than being strictly constrained to limited conditions. Besides, using this method, researchers can obtain abundant qual- itative data that shows viewers’ thoughts and opinions in-depth, which is important to a user experience study."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"We selected the stimuli used in this study from the corpus collected in Section 3, which contains 72 serious data stories that the experts thought elicit negative emotions. To control the amount of the stimuli while reducing the noises brought by story content, we presented the participants with stories with the same topic, following the methodology in [ 80]. Besides, to facilitate the assessment of design, the stories should cover as many identified design methods as possible. With these issues in mind, we extracted17 stories whose topic is COVID-19 from the corpus."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data story,"Among these stories, 3 are not English stories, and 1 (i.e., the Johns Hopkins Dashboard [ 25]) is controversial as some experts did not think it should be counted as a data story. Therefore, we removed these 4 cases from the list and kept 13 data stories about COVID-19 as the stimuli (see Fig. 3). The 13 stories are from diverse authors and cover all the 19 design methods summarized in Section 3. For example, S1 in Fig. 3 uses distorted shapes and massive red to visualize the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. S6 explains the huge amount of deaths by showing viewers how many buses would be needed to load all the dead bodies."

We paid each participant $25. 4.1.4 Procedure. To begin with, we informed the participants that they would be going to view 3 data stories about COVID-19 and obtained their consent to voice recording. The participants then filled out a brief online questionnaire to provide their gender, age, education level, educational background, expertise in data visual- ization, and frequency of reading data stories. Next, the participants were presented with 3 data stories about COVID-19 randomly cho- sen from our stimuli, one at a time. The order of the 3 stories was also random. After ensuring that the participants had not seen the story before, the experimenter went to the next room and came back when the participants stated that they had finished viewing the story. Then, the participants filled out an online questionnaire which asked them to rate: (i) 48 EARL emotions, (ii) 4 prompts about contemplative experiences, (iii) 7 prompts about user engagement, (iv) 3 prompts about meta-emotion, and (v) list all the thoughts that crossed their minds during and after the viewing process [ 9]."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data story,"The participants were first asked to elaborate their emotional experience with the story (“Could you please walk us through your emotional journey when viewing this story?”), then answered more in-depth questions such as “What happened in the story that made you feel this emotion?”, “Why do you like/dislikethis emotion?”, and “How the design method influenced your emo- tion?” Next, the participants saw a blank screen for 5 seconds to clear their thoughts and feelings [ 38] and view the next data story. We iterated the above process (i.e., story viewing, questionnaire survey, interview) until each participant had finished viewing 3 data stories. Last, we informed the participants that there would be an online interview 2-3 weeks later and asked them to schedule their time. To avoid intentional learning, we did not mention the specific reason for the interview (i.e., measure long-term recall). Each participant spent about 1.5 hours completing the lab study."

The most recalled design-emotion pairs (e.g., pic- ture with negative semantics and sadness) were generally consistent with those mentioned in the lab. In general, the better remembered design methods kept their central positions or became more central in the network (e.g., concrete scale ,role-playing game ). By contrast, the less remembered design methods (e.g., stretched layout ) became more marginalized in the network."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"Besides, the varied lingering effect of these design methods may also influence their effectiveness in communicating negativity in the long run. 5 DISCUSSION By investigating serious data stories, this work has shown that emo- tional experiences beyond positivity can be valuable in data-driven storytelling. Negative emotions, although seemingly less enjoyable or fun than positive emotions, can be beneficial and worthwhile to experience. Especially, fueled by the integration of new design methods such as gamification and multi-modal interaction, it would be increasingly necessary to extend traditional means of evaluating data stories and capture more complex forms of user experience. Also, our work has suggested the importance to include both sto- rytellers and viewers, immediate and lingering experience in the evaluation of data stories. Such a combination of different perspec- tives will allow us to obtain a richer understanding of the process of data communication. Below we list two main takeaways ( T1and T2) that arise from our work. Eliciting negative emotions seems to be a double-edged sword (T1)."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data storytelling,"In the context of serious data storytelling, we found that negative emotions contributed to contemplative experiences and long-term recall (T1.1). However, enhancing user engagement, as another benefit proposed by some experts, was not entirely supported by our user study. How to convey negative emotions while interesting and attracting viewers using data visu- alization design is still an open question. Besides, the pitfalls of eliciting negative emotions for data stories are still contro- versial (T1.2). In our studies, while some experts and participants showed an open attitude to embrace the subjective power of data, some expressed their hesitation. This kind of worry resonates with some classic arguments in the visualization community, such as avoiding manipulating viewers’ perceptions of data [ 22,28,32] and understanding the exact impact of emotions on cognitive pro- cesses [ 42]. Regarding this issue, our study has provided some empirical evidence."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data stories,"We mitigated this limitation by encouraging the experts to contribute diverse stories (resulting in 72 serious data stories in total) and moderating an in-depth focus group until the discussion about design had reached a point of saturation [ 56]. It should also be noticed that the effectiveness of these design techniques in terms of augmenting negative emotions should be understood within the context of our study (i.e., serious data storytelling) as we examined data stories whose content is inherently negative. Second, the results derived from our study with viewers were constrained by the limited stimuli presented as well as the relatively small sample size of the participants. Especially, the participants we recruited are relatively highly-educated, which may have influenced the study results. According to previous literature [ 1], information visualization education is less accessible to people outside of higher education, thus making it harder for them to interpret visualization design."
A45,"Negative Emotions, Positive Outcomes? Exploring the Communication of Negativity in Serious Data Stories",1,1,data story,"More work should be done to understand the causal interplay among negative emotions, data story design, and user ex- perience. Meanwhile, by incorporating more designers, users, and CHI ’22, April 29-May 5, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA Lan, et al. visualizations into research, future studies could conduct more qual- itative research to understand the visual communication process and the role of visualization design more in-depth. Last, the verbal descriptions of the participants about their emo- tional experiences may have been incomplete or ambiguous. This limitation was mitigated by giving the participants adequate time to elaborate on their experiences and by asking more in-depth questions in the interviews requiring detailed clarification. 7 CONCLUSION This work explores negative emotions in serious data stories by conducting studies with both storytellers and viewers. Through the workshop with 9 data story experts, we identified 3 possible benefits of eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories and 19 potential design methods that contribute to negative emotions. Through a user study with 35 participants, we confirmed that nega- tive emotions do not necessarily lead to negative consequences. By contrast, they can be powerful and rewarding. The results showed that negative emotions significantly facilitated contemplative ex- periences and long-term memory, and increased user engagement from limited aspects."

A46,"Towards Design Guidelines for Effective Health-Related Data Videos: An Empirical Investigation of Affect, Personality, and Video Content",1,1,data storytelling,"While visual data storytelling  that depends on pictures and graphs (i.e., infographics), has proven  efcacy in the feld of data visualization, Gershon and Page argue  that putting such visuals in a video format can take the story to a  whole new level [37]. While “a picture is worth a thousand words"",  a video that elaborates and supports that picture with animation,  audio narration, music, and sound efects is considered to be “worth  a million pictures"" according to Gershon and Page [37]. The poten- tial of videos for data storytelling has been further amplifed with  the emerging popularity of data-based videos, or DVs, on social  media platforms such as Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok,  which are easily accessible to a wide audience using various smart  devices. While DVs are beginning to attract the attention of HCI and  visualization researchers to understand their building blocks [5]  and provide tools to create such videos [7, 60], they are still a novel  form of data visualization [5, 6, 20], and human perception in the  context of DVs has not been explored fully yet despite its rele- vance. In this research, we explore DVs targeting common health  issues (physical activity, sleep, and diet) to understand the factors  afecting their ability to infuence their viewers’ health-related be- havioural intentions. Given the brevity of DVs [5, 41], we focus  on DVs’ ability to infuence their viewers’ perception of the topic  (i.e., targeting viewers’ intentions/willingness to improve their be- haviour, but not actual behavioural change)."
A46,"Towards Design Guidelines for Effective Health-Related Data Videos: An Empirical Investigation of Affect, Personality, and Video Content",1,1,narrative visualization,"Due to their  narrative nature, DVs are recognized as one of the seven forms of  narrative visualizations [18, 77].

Each computational notebook consists of multiple  input and output cells for code editing and result presentation [ 5]."
A47,Notable: On-the-Fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,1,1,data story,"Further- more, the sequence of data exploration in computational notebooks  may not entirely ft the narrative structure of a data story [22]. Therefore, it is necessary for users to select the important fndings,  document the fndings with text descriptions and visual highlights,  and organize them into a logically coherent data story for commu- nication [22]. According to our interviews with experienced data  analysts, such workfow often require them to use multiple tools  (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint3 and Google Slides4), which increases  their workload due to (1) the additional operations to transfer data  fndings between tools and (2) the distraction led by multiple user  interfaces with inconsistent appearances and interactions. To cater the need for convenient data communication, several  existing tools are developed to support data storytelling. For ex- ample, Violà [54] and Nbconvert [20] enable convenient format  conversion from notebooks to presentations. However, they only  support direct format conversion and cannot facilitate other steps  in data storytelling, such as story organization. To fll the gap, a  recent tool, NB2Slides [69], adopted advanced machine learning  techniques to organize an accomplished notebook into slides based  on pre-defned templates. However, it assumes that users fnish the  1https://jupyter.org/ 2https://www.rstudio.com/  3https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint  4https://www.google.com/slides/about/ entire data analysis process before making data stories, which does  not align well with the empirical observation of switching between  data exploration and story creation [ 14, 26]. Users can hardly con- sider data storytelling and exploration comprehensively in such  settings. Given the drawback of existing tools, we would like to  explore how we can provide on-the-fy support to data storytelling  during data exploration in computational notebooks. To answer the research question, we frst attempted to fgure out  the challenges and desired assistance regarding data storytelling  in computational notebooks. We conducted formative interviews  with six data analysts with diverse backgrounds and summarized  fve design requirements of the storytelling tool in computational  notebooks. The interviewees frequently mentioned their need for  assistance in data fnding documentation and organization. Fur- thermore, they mentioned the inconvenient switching between data  exploration and storytelling when using computational notebooks."

To evaluate whether Notable is helpful to users,  we conducted a user study with 12 participants. The feedback from  them demonstrates the usability and efectiveness of Notable . Fi- nally, we concluded our research by discussing the lessons learned  and potential future directions."
A47,Notable: On-the-Fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,1,1,data storytelling,"To summarize, the contributions of our paper include:  • The design requirements for storytelling tools in computa- tional notebooks;  • A computational notebook extension, Notable , which ofers  on-the-fy assistance to data storytelling;  • The design lessons and future opportunities learned from  the research.  2 RELATED WORK  In this section, we review research on visual analysis in computa- tional notebooks, data storytelling, and data fact recommendation.  2.1 Visual Data Analysis with Computational  Notebooks  Computational notebooks have been widely applied in data analysis  since it enables the integrated display of code and results, which  facilitates the iterative nature of data analysis better [39]. In ex- isting computational notebook environments, visual data analysis  is supported by packages for convenient plotting (e.g., Altair [ 52],  Bqplot [2], Plotly [36], and Matplotlib [19]) and tools targeting at  visualizing specifc machine learning models (e.g., TimberTrek [59]  and Calibrate [65]). Notable : On-the-fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks CHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany  The aforementioned plotting packages are widely used but lim- ited to showing the visualizations specifed by the user and do  not provide additional assistance. Recent studies have been pro- posed to augment them by providing intelligent assistance to data  exploration (e.g., [8, 27, 55, 64, 68]). For example, Lux [27] recom- mends lists of static visualizations to users without requiring them  to specify visualizations explicitly. Considering the importance of  interactions in visual analysis [66], PI1 recommends interactive  visualizations when users query data from databases [68]."
A47,Notable: On-the-Fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,1,1,data storytelling,"However, they only help format conversion and  cannot cover other steps in data storytelling. In our research, we  propose Notable , a notebook extension, to facilitate data storytelling  during data exploration. Despite generating slides for presenting  the data story, Notable also ofers assistance in (1) illustrating data  fndings with text description and visual embellishments; and (2)  organizing selected data facts into stories.  2.2 Data Storytelling  Data storytelling, as an efective way to communicate information  in data, has gained more attention in recent years [50]. It serves  as the fnal stage in data analysis and is closely connected with  data exploration [62]. To facilitate data storytelling, various types  of tools have been proposed. According to the level of automation,  they can be roughly classifed into three clusters, authoring tools,  automatic generation tools, and tools with intelligent support [6]. Authoring tools provide interactive interfaces for users to create  data stories freely. For example, Idyll Studio [10] and VizFlow [47]  support data article creation by integrating chart creation and arti- cle editing in a unifed interface. CLUE [14] and InsideInsights [ 33]  allow users to create data presentations with the identifed fndings  in data exploration. ToonNote [21] integrates a data comic author- ing interface with computational notebooks."
A47,Notable: On-the-Fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,1,1,data stories,"To reduce the consid- erable manual eforts in creating data stories, fully automatic data  story generation tools have been explored. They leverage machine  learning techniques to analyze datasets and generate narrative vi- sualizations. Under this category, Wang et al. [58], Shi et al. [43],  and Lu et al. [32] automate fact sheet, data video and scrollytelling  creation from datasets. Similarly, Roslingifer [45] detects important  events in time series data and generates animation automatically."
A47,Notable: On-the-Fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,1,1,data stories,"Chen et al. [7] attempted to synthesize data stories according to the  analytical provenance. InfoMotion [57] creates animated infograph- ics according to the structure of information inside infographics. However, automatic story generation tools limit users’ participation  in storytelling and thus may result in bias and untrust [28]. To achieve the collaboration of humans and machines, tools  that provide intelligent support to data storytelling have gained  increasing interest (e.g., [13, 34, 48, 61, 67]). For example, Erato [48]  recommends new data facts based on user-selected facts for com- pleting data stories and generating infographics. According to a  recent survey [6], most of the existing tools support infographic or  video and animation creation, while making slides receives little at- tention. According to Hullman et al. [18], slides are frequently used  for communicating data stories. However, making slides requires  non-trivial eforts from data scientists [35]. To assist with slide  creation, Zheng et al. [69] developed NB2Slides to convert human- made computational notebooks to slides based on pre-defned tem- plates. However, NB2Slides takes a one-way style that generates  slides after a complete data analysis session."
A47,Notable: On-the-Fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,1,1,data story,"Such features may not  suit the common workfow of data analysts as they often switch  between data story creation and data exploration, according to  previous research [14, 26]. To better ft the workfow, we propose  to ofer on-the-fy assistance in Notable to support story creation  during data exploration. Users are able to take storytelling into con- sideration when exploring data. Furthermore, our tool is integrated  into widely used computational notebooks, which is preferred over  new tools, such as Erato [48], as indicated in our formative study.  2.3 Data Fact Recommendation  Since manual visual data exploration requires data analysis skills  and enormous efort [ 1], recent research introduces automatic data  fact recommendation methods to address this challenge [25]."
A47,Notable: On-the-Fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,1,1,data stories,"Then the docu- mented fndings would be organized into data stories. To present  data stories, the interviewees needed to prepare slides. We summa- rize three key fndings regarding the pain points and their expected  tools.  3.3.1 Manual documenting and organizing data findings. In the  interview, all interviewees mentioned the difculties of document- ing the discovered data fndings during data exploration. First,  they had to manually record the data fndings and highlight the  key data points on the chart."
A47,Notable: On-the-Fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks,1,1,data stories,"He could notice logical  faws in his data analysis during authoring data stories and then  went back to data exploration. P4 also said “I repeatedly iterate  between exploration and storytelling” since he could get new ideas  when preparing his stories. The feedback reveals that storytelling is  bi-directionally connected with data exploration, which aligns with  previous observations [14, 26, 62]. Making the story also inspires  and guides the process of data exploration."

Notable frst identifes the facts in specifed charts and illustrates  them. Then the selected facts are organized into a story. Follow- ing a previous study [58], we characterize data facts using seven  attributes: subspace to record the flters that are applied to gain the  visualized data subset; measures to indicate the dependent variables  in the chart; dimension to represent the independent variable in  a chart; type of data facts (e.g., trend and outlier); parameters to  describe the details of the fact, such as the direction of trends; focus  to document the data point that is emphasized in the fact; and score  to measure both how the fact matched users’ intent of exploration  and how important the fact is.  4.3 Computation Modules  In this section, we introduce the computation modules that support  the interactive modules.  4.3.1 Fact Illustration."

For example, according to the statistics, 42 in 57 trend  facts are represented with line charts. Then the suitability score of  illustrating a trend fact in a line chart is 42/57 = 0.74. Since the  ultimate goal of our paper is data storytelling, it is more suitable  to use the relationship between fact types and chart types in data  stories rather than in other scenarios (e.g., [40]). Furthermore, the impact of context is meaningless in our set- ting since all facts derived from one chart have the same context. Therefore, we only keep the impact of focus and calculate it as  Notable : On-the-fly Assistant for Data Storytelling in Computational Notebooks CHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany  Table 2: The table presents templates of text descriptions generated by the fact illustration module.

CHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany The appeal of unit visualizations, in contrast to aggregate visualiza- tions (e.g., bar charts), is that they harness one-to-one mappings between visual marks and data points to afford diverse, nuanced animations. These animations are especially suitable for commu- nicating data insights as they deliver information in small chunks, smoothly leading viewers to a final takeaway message [ 14,19,54]. However, data-driven articles and videos are notoriously difficult to create due to the inherent complexity of combining a large num- ber of heterogeneous elements (e.g., text, visualizations, animations, interactions, etc.) into a single piece of content [ 18]."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"The goal of this research is thus to systematically explore the chal- lenges that exist while creating data stories that employ complex and compelling AUVs, and then identify opportunities to streamline the creation process. To this end, we conducted a 2-part formative study that consisted of an interview-based study with 6 AUV cre- ators to understand the challenges in their workflows, and a content analysis of 44 data-driven articles and videos to investigate the char- acteristics and patterns contained within such media. The formative study found that authoring data stories with AUVs is extremely challenging because it is difficult to plan and prototype. Typical prototyping techniques (e.g., sketching) cannot accurately capture the number of visual units nor represent the dynamic ani- mations that creators envision. As a result, creators resort to using coding languages to programmatically specify the parameters and behaviors of hundreds and thousands of data points. This process, however, is indirect, tedious, and time-consuming."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"The content anal- ysis found that data stories use a section-based narrative structure, and within each section, the text in the story closely corresponds to the underlying data selections, operations, visual encodings, and animations needed for each AUV. These formative studies highlighted the opportunity to lever- age the desired connections and organization between text and visuals to supporting planning, exploring, and composing of data stories with rich AUVs. We propose DataParticles, a system that facilitates the authoring process of AUVs with two components, a language-oriented animation authoring technique that enables users to leverage natural language to create congruent visualizations and animations, and a block-based story editor that enables creators to flexibly iterate on their story narrative while maintaining congru- ence with the visuals. To assess the utility of DataParticles, we conducted an expert evaluation with 9 professional data story cre- ators. The results showed that the language-oriented, block-based authoring environment enabled the authoring process to be story- focused and facilitated creation by enabling flexible prototyping. This research thus contributes:(1)Aformative study with 6 expert creators that identifies the common workflows and pain points that exist when creating data-driven stories with AUVs. (2)Acontent analysis of 44 stories with AUVs that identifies common patterns their narrative structures and the map- pings that exist between the text and visuals. (3)Aprototype system, DataParticles, that leverages the text and visual mappings to create a language-driven, block- based authoring experience for data stories with AUVs. (4)Anexpert evaluation that confirmes the utility of Data- Particles, revealing insightful design implications for future design prototyping and language-oriented authoring tools. While this research focuses on supporting creating data stories with AUVs, we envision the proposed user interface and interaction techniques can be applied to other types of data visualizations (e.g., aggregated charts). 2 RELATED WORK This work draws on prior research on unit visualizations, data storytelling, natural language oriented interactions and block-based interfaces for content creation. 2.1 Unit Visualizations Unit, or glyph-based, visualizations are visualizations that repre- sent every data point using a unique visual mark, whose visual and spatial properties encode the attributes of the data point [ 5,15,31]. The rich visual representation of each individual data point has re- sulted in unit visualizations being an increasingly popular medium for communicating data in a range of scenarios, such as infograph- ics [62], data-driven animations [ 3], AR visualizations [ 8], and data physicalizations [ 1]. Prior work has presented a series of tools, frameworks, and design spaces to facilitate the creation of unit visualizations. For example, Drucker and Fernandez characterized the design space of common unit visualizations and proposed a unifying framework [ 15]."

Segel and Heer catego- rized seven genres of data-driven storytelling, including articles and videos [ 36]. Due to the storytelling power they offer and the challenging authoring processes required, these forms of narrative visualizations have been gaining traction in HCI and visualization communities over the past few years. Prior work in this domain has contributed to understanding the workflow of current authoring practices. Lee et al., for example, identified that data storytelling pro- cesses often involve three major steps: finding insights from data, turning insights into narratives, and communicating this narrative to the audience [ 26]. Similarly, Sultanum et al. showed that authors usually started with a dataset or a particular question to answer using the data and then organized the main findings into a linear structure to present [ 45]. During this process, synthesizing informa- tion across multiple resources, making decisions about rich visual effects, and contextualizing data facts into coherent narratives were found to be challenging [ 18,45]. To address these challenges, sig- nificant research has been conducted to summarize design spaces to guide and simplify the authoring process [ 2,7,12,45–47] and to develop new authoring tools [4, 13, 24, 40, 45, 48]."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"As animated data stories are often created by a group of creators, we recruited experts across different roles to have a comprehensive understanding of such workflows. Through these interviews, we found that among the various types of data stories the interviewees had created, the ones that consisted of AUVs were noted as being both compelling and challenging to create, as they exacerbated many of the pain points of complex animation authoring processes. 3.1 Interviewees and Procedure Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six domain experts who had professional experience creating data stories with AUVs. Each of the interviewees had over 5 years of experience creating different types of animated data stories, where their roles acorss producer, animator, visualization engineer, or journalist. The interviews began with background questions about intervie- wees’ roles and professional histories. Interviewees were then asked about their workflows when creating stories with AUVs, includ- ing the tools that they used, and the pain points they encountered throughout the process. We summarized our findings in terms of the workflows and challenges in creating AUVs. 3.2 Workflows While Creating AUVs The workflows employed while creating animated data stories con- sisted of three major steps. First, narratives about the data stories were developed to guide production. Second, visualizations and ani- mations were created based on the narrative planning, starting from low-fidelity prototypes and moving to high-fidelity designs. Third, the narrative and visuals were composed to form a complete story. While these three high-level steps were commonly taken during the entire creation by all interviewees, we identified two different approaches during planning and prototyping phases: data-driven planning and story-driven planning."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"All interviewees employed a two-column script to plan their data stories, where the first column broke down the text narrative into sections and the second column showed the corresponding visuals to be created. However, interviewees noted that specifying desired AUVs was extremely challenging compared to static graphics and aggregated visualizations because the an- imations of units were difficult to prototype using sketching or digital prototyping tools such as Keynote. It was thus challeng- ing to speculate on the final look of an AUV in terms of whether it would coherently support their narrative. Due to this lack of concrete specifications during the planning stage, creators often made many design decisions during the creation process without knowing whether they might deviate from their overall storytelling goal, requiring more downstream iterations."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"As noted by E6, “we have to have a decent background in both design and code to be able to build them, along with a con- siderable amount of time.” In addition to using the typical view transitions found with unit visualizations, data stories often em- ployed ‘per data point’ animations (e.g., highlighting and pulsing) to guide users’ attention through the flow of the story. Although these animations were not technically challenging to create, the sheer number of them required tedious manual effort. Especially in video-based stories, interviewees used dedicated animation tools (e.g., Adobe AfterEffects) for final touches or animations that were difficult to create using programming. 3.3.3 Repetitive Synchronization for Story-Visual Congruence. In- terviewees stated that matching the story with the visuals was crucial for effective communication and storytelling."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"The findings suggest that creators of data stories can significantly benefit from flexible prototyping and structured scaffolding for the entire authoring process, especially earlier in the planning stage. 4 CONTENT ANALYSIS OF DATA STORIES CONTAINING AUVS To better understand the characteristics and design patterns of AUVs within data stories, especially how AUVs correspond with the text, we conducted a content analysis of data stories that employed AUVs. We surveyed data stories that were part of interactive data articles and data videos and curated 44 data stories from well-known platforms known for producing data stories, including Vox [ 55], the Pudding [ 51], the New York Times [ 50], the Guardian [ 49], etc. We divided the stories based on the section structure into 403 sections, which contain the textual narrative and the corresponding AUV. We focused on two aspects of the data stories: (1) the overall narrative and organizational structures of the stories, and (2) the correspondences between the stories and their AUVs. 4.1 Narrative and Organization Structures Despite their different forms, data-driven articles and videos were found to employ similar narratives and content organizational struc- tures. We summarized some story patterns as here (Figure 2a). 4.1.1 Inverted Pyramid Narrative Structure. A popular narrative structure surfaced through the analysis was the inverted pyramid narrative structure (35/44 stories). With this structure, stories first introduced the high-level context of the story: the scope, back- ground, and key messages."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"They specifically referred to the changes in visual encodings, such as color, size, and CHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Figure 2: Patterns in existing data stories containing AUVs.

(b) Examples of 4 key phrases we identified in AUVs that link language to visual effects in AUVs. position. For example, phrases such as “highlight” and“coloring” in- dicated a change in color encoding; “distribute, ” “range, ” and“across” indicated a change in position encoding; “width” and“height” indi- cated a change in size of the visual units. These phrases were used to help create engaging and effective visual stories by highlighting key information and guiding the viewer’s attention. 4.3 Summary Our content analysis showed that data stories with AUVs often used a section-based structure to organize the narration and visual- izations. These stories deliver data insights through incremental visual changes and specific narrative structures, such as inverted pyramid and parallel structures. We also observed a strong cor- respondence between the segments of an informative story and their desired visualizations. In particular, we identified four types of phrases in the narration that could be used to inform the visual states and transitions in these stories."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"These findings can be useful for creating more effective and engaging visual stories. 5 DESIGN DECISIONS The formative study and content analysis revealed strong corre- spondences between the text and visuals in data stories with AUVs. While the correspondences are typically achieved at the planning stage (e.g. using a two-column script) and in the final content (e.g. using a section-based structure), they are hard to maintain during the prototyping and creation stages, resulting in repetitive actions to keep the story and visuals synchronized. This presents an op- portunity to leverage the text in a narrative to ensure the desired correspondences throughout the entire design process. We hence propose the following design decisions: D1."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"D2.We will use block-based editing , where a section of a narra- tive and its corresponding visuals will be organized withinone block throughout the entire design process to en- able flexible prototyping of the story, visualizations, and animations while ensuring their correspondence. 6 DATAPARTICLES DataParticles is a prototype system that uses language-oriented edit- ingandblock-based editing to address the challenges of prototyping and iterating on data stories with AUVs. DataParticles consists of five UI components. The rich text editor (Figure 3a) allows the user to input text with natural language to tell a story. The view panel (Figure 3b) animates the corresponding visualization while the user is typing."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data stories,"These com- ponents work together to enable users to quickly create and iterate on data stories with AUVs. Next, we introduce how AUVs can be generated from natural language (Section 6.1), how iteration and exploration are supported via the block-based editor (Section 6.2). We then provide an ex- ample walk-through to showcase the user experience of using the DataParticles to create an AUV data story (Section 6.3). 6.1 Natural Language to AUVs To support the authoring of congruent visual stories [D1], we de- signed a four-step pipeline that uses the text in a block to generate and update AUVs: (1) selecting the relevant data points, (2) per- forming data operations on the selected data points, (3) specifying the visual encoding, and (4) configuring the animations between blocks. While the user is writing in a block, DataParticles detects the four key types of phrases and uses constituency parsing [ 21] to understand the pragmatic structure of their writing. Based on the parsed sentence, DataParticles automatically determines the intended data selection and encoding. This information defines a visual state of the block, which the system uses to generate an DataParticles: Block-based and Language-oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations CHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Figure 3: The DataParticles user interface includes (a) a rich text editor for natural language inputs, (b) a view panel that shows AUVs in real time, (c) a visual effects configuration panel to allow for the customization of animation effects, (d) a block operation toolbox that provides four block operations including add, copy, drag and delete, and (e) a dataset view panel that connects the data points to the original dataset. animation that illustrates the transition of visual states between the current and previous blocks."

She collected a dataset of 28 coffee pods from the with 4 attributes: coffee name, coffee type, intensity, and aroma. Fiona first opens DataParticles in a web browser."

All participants had more than 3 years of experience in data storytelling and had pro- fessional experience authoring AUVs. The studies were conducted remotely via Zoom. Participants accessed DataParticles through a web browser. They received a $40 dollar gift card for the 75-90 minute session. 7.2 Study Protocol Participants first completed a consent form and were then in- structed to complete three tasks with DataParticles via screen DataParticles: Block-based and Language-oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations CHI ’23, April 23–28, 2023, Hamburg, Germany Figure 7: A user changing and maintaining visual flow using DataParticles."

Participants found that being able to immediately see the visualizations helped them focus on the story they were telling, and they generally agreed that the visualizations generated by the system matched their narrations (2 strongly agree, 6 agree, 1 somewhat agree). This supports the first design goal (D1) of DataParticles, which was to maintain the connections between narrative stories and the visualizations."

While it was able to properly understand the partic- ipants’ intentions during the study, this may be insufficient for a story-driven planning. In order to support this, the system should be able to handle more flexible text input with improved natural language processing capabilities. 7.4 Summary All nine expert participants were excited about the potential of using DataParticles to improve their workflows when creating data stories with rich AUVs. They appreciated that DataParticles en- abled them to quickly visualize their ideas and experiment with different story ideas like a “digital sketch book for data.” Specifi- cally, language-oriented authoring enabled participants to be story- driven and block-based editing enables quick and flexible prototyp- ing."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data storytelling,"Although these visualizations are not within the scope of our system, they are commonly used in data storytelling [ 17] and could potentially benefit from a more flexible prototyping experi- ence. Herein, we discuss the opportunities and challenges when extending our system to support these types of visualizations. Aggregated visualizations contain simpler graphic elements and more structured layouts, which make them a promising candidate to establish a link between text and visuals throughout a story, es- pecially with the help of existing work in this domain [ 9,38]. How- ever, unlike unit visualizations, whose visual marks almost always remain unchanged during animations, transitions of aggregated vi- sualizations often employ complex graphical transformations, such as transforming a line chart into a bar chart by transforming lines and dots into rectangles."
A48,DataParticles: Block-Based and Language-Oriented Authoring of Animated Unit Visualizations,1,1,data storytelling,"We are interested in extending DataParticles with a more advanced animation engine and intelligent data selection techniques, to support a broader coverage of visualizations. 9 CONCLUSION This work presents a systematic exploration of a specific domain of data storytelling that uses animated unit visualizations (AUVs). The research prototype, DataParticles, leveraged language-oriented authoring and block-based editing to address the pain points that exist when creating stories containing AUVs. With DataParticles, users could leverage the latent connections among text, data, and visualizations to quickly and flexibly prototype, explore, and iterate on both a story narrative and its corresponding visualizations. Feed- back from creative experts confirmed the potential of this approach and pointed to future directions for improvement."

To explore this gap, we designed and ran a workshop on data comics, organized by an interdisci- plinary team with expertise in data visualization, graphic design, data comics, and illustration. The  workshop was part of a 3-week assignment in an undergraduate illustration class at the College of  Art, Edinburgh University. The workshop aimed to provide students with experience in employing  data-driven storytelling and human-centered design thinking.

While they perform well in speciﬁc scenarios,  they do not customize the generated sequences to indi- vidual users’ preferences. In this work, we present Vis-Guide , an assistive data exploration system that helps  a user create contextual visualization sequence trees by  sequentially recommending meaningful charts tailoring to the user’s preference on data exploration. Our results  show that VisGuide can recommend chart sequences that  interest users and are also considered meaningful by do- main experts."

Pre-vious studies recommend charts using features on data  statistics to identify interesting charts [19, 13, 4, 5, 18, 2,  15, 12, 16]. However, without a contextual ordering strat- egy, these charts cannot present comprehensible data  stories. To arrange charts in an understandable order, Hullman et al.[8] conducted user studies and identiﬁed two structure patterns that can improve the comprehen- sibility of sequences: hierarchical structure that groups  subsets of charts with shared data properties, such as common measure, time period, or spatial region; and  parallel structure, which repeats a pattern of transitions  several times in a sequence."

The primary challenge in making Metroverse stems from the complexity of the underlying research and data, both of which need to be effectively communicated to a wide range of end-users with different backgrounds. To unravel the complexity of the re- search, and to design the platform, we followed a user-centered design process. Our design process brought together researchers, designers, and various end-users, who collectively guided the de- sign of the narrative visualization. Engaging end-users in the early phases of the project allowed us to identify the valuable insights in the data and subsequently design effective visualizations that convey those insights. We believe findings from our process can pro- vide a template for similar projects that require translating complex research data and methodologies into user-friendly story structures.

A55,Unraveling The Complexity: A User-Centered Design Process For Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"We adopted similar methods in our product strategy and designed a narrative visualization that translates research and raw data into a user-friendly storytelling structure with functional data visualizations. However, when build- ing Metroverse, our team encountered two fundamental problems: (1) How could we distill scientific, multidisciplinary research and data into usable insights suitable for policymakers and urban of- ficials who may not normally engage with theoretical concepts? (2) How could we design a user experience (UX) that effectively communicated these insights to a diverse group of users? To address these problems, we embarked on an iterative and col- laborative process that included product discovery, user research, and design initiatives. The result was a narrative visualization plat- form that distilled Metroverse’s underlying research and analysis into a coherent collection of data visualizations connected by a narrative structure that guided the user’s journey. 3 PROCESS In this section, we explain the three main steps in creating the Metroverse. First, product discovery included research and data discovery phases, involving two-way knowledge sharing between our team and the research team about data, research methodologies,and best practices for storytelling with interactive data visualiza- tion. Second, at different stages of the project, our user research initiatives included persona building, user interviews, and user tests. Lastly, we employed wireframing and prototyping in the design process, which allowed us to create, test, and iterate ideas quickly, as well as collaborate with the research team."

A55,Unraveling The Complexity: A User-Centered Design Process For Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"By doing so, we tried to have features from author- and reader-driven narrative visualization techniques. During the research and data discovery phase, the research team emphasized the importance of introducing a comparison feature in which users can compare their selected city against another city or a group of cities. This comparison feature created a series of usabil- ity challenges in the user journey because users were periodically interrupted to select another city to use the comparison feature. In order to understand these usability challenges and detect exactly where users were interrupted, we conducted a series of user tests and visualized every tester’s user journey through wireframes."

INTRODUCTION  Storytelling with data is rapidly becoming prominent both in  practice and academia. Leading media outlets such as the  New York Times and the Guardian are increasingly  exposing the general public to stories with visual depictions  of data, or narrative visualizations [20, 27]. Data videos –  custom motion graphics combining both visual and auditory  stimuli to promote a data story – are one among the seven genres of narrative visualizations [27]. The popularity of  data videos could be attributed to the diverse forms of  narrative structures and the wide range of visuals they  expose an audience to within a short presentation time. As a  result, researchers have argued that data videos can be  highly impactful, making it a particularly interesting form of  narrative visualization to study. Despite the great potential that data videos can offer, we  know very little about their constituent characteristics to  help create narratives using this medium. Such knowledge  can be instrumental in allowing a broader audience to design  and craft data videos. We consider this work as a first step  toward understanding data videos and a basis for  developing, in the future, novel tools geared towards  generating compelling data stories using this medium. As empirical knowledge can be the cornerstone for early  design implications [11], we attain our goals with two  exploratory studies. In a first exploration, we identify the  high-level narrative structures  found in professionally  created data videos and expose their key components. We  carry out a qualitative examination of the narrative  structures in 50 professional data videos collected from a  range of reputable sources through the lens of established  disciplines such as film theory and cinematography [13, 15]."
A56,Understanding Data Videos: Looking at Narrative Visualization through the Cinematography Lens,1,1,narrative visualization,"Research pieces directly aimed at providing solutions to  help people craft narrative visualizations are scarce [12, 21]. We believe that our community needs to develop a larger  body of knowledge on narrative visualizations,  characterizing their key components but also studying the  process to craft them. Such knowledge will inform the  design of tools that would help a wide range of people  consume and craft stories with data visualization. Segel and Heer [27] initiated a first step in identifying  genres of narrative visualizations by conducting an analysis  of 58 narrative visualizations. They proposed a broad view  of narrative visualizations integrating in their analysis static  infographics, comics, slide-shows, video, and animations. Their insights offer a general sense of the range of visual  and narrative components used in storytelling with data. More focused studies of narrative visualizations have  explored specific genres or aspects of narrative  visualizations. Bateman et al. [9] and Borkin et al. [10]  specifically focused on understanding infographics and what  makes them appealing or memorable to a large audience. Hullman et al. [19] discussed categories of rhetorical  techniques drawn from an online journalism corpus. The  more relevant to ours is Hullman et al.’s [20] work on the  analysis of sequences in storytelling with data. While this  work focused on specific transitions between visuals, we  take a more holistic view of the narrative structure and  characterize higher-level structure in data videos. While these previous studies have deepened our knowledge  on the composition of narrative visualizations, identifying  what makes them compelling or memorable, none of these  studies have looked at the process involved in crafting them. We also aim to fill this gap and report insights on the  creation process involved in crafting data videos. Even though research is sparse regarding the structure of  storytelling with data visualizations, there is a wealth of  research on narrative story structure in other fields such as  literature [15], cinematography [24], or comics [13, 25]. We aimed at building on this body of work, looking at the  composition of data videos through this lens. In particular,  we analyzed data videos using the theory of visual narrative  structures described by Cohn [13]. This approach attempts  to unify different perspectives on narrative structures in  different genres."

Information Interfaces and Presentation (e.g. HCI): Miscellaneous INTRODUCTION In this article, our interest is to assess whether augmenting ex- ploratory information visualizations with initial narrative vi- sualization techniques and storytelling can help engage users in exploration. Many online data graphics use narrative de- sign elements to explain a given dataset in a straightforward and compelling way."
A57,Storytelling in Information Visualizations: Does It Engage Users to Explore Data?,1,1,narrative visualization,"Here, we explore the po- tential of narrative visualization techniques and storytelling to trigger this desired user-engagement. By engagement, we speciﬁcally mean a user’s investment in the exploration of a visualization. We present the results of three web-based ﬁeld experiments, in which we compare user-behavior on a series of exploratory visualization webpages we designed that either included an initial ‘story’, or did not. After the background section of this article, we describe the design of our ﬁrst experiment, present our analysis of user- behavior, and discuss our results."
A57,Storytelling in Information Visualizations: Does It Engage Users to Explore Data?,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative Visualizations Hullman & Diakoplous deﬁne narrative information visual- izations as “a style of visualization that often explores the in- terplay between aspects of both explorative and communica- tive visualization. They typically rely on a combination of persuasive, rhetorical techniques to convey an intended story to users as well as exploratory, dialectic strategies aimed at providing the user with control over the insights she gains from interaction” [15]. This interplay raises a tension previ- ously identiﬁed by Segel & Heer between author-driven and reader-driven scenarios [24]. Author-driven scenarios follow a linear structure intended by the author."
A57,Storytelling in Information Visualizations: Does It Engage Users to Explore Data?,1,1,narrative visualization,"Segel & Heer also propose a design space for narrative de- sign elements [24, Fig.7], and identify three common struc- tures of interactive narrative visualizations: the Martini Glass structure, the Interactive Slideshow, and the Drill-Down story. Here, we focus on the ﬁrst two. The Martini Glass has a two-stage structure: ﬁrst, the user goes through a relatively heavily author-driven scenario, in which the visualization is introduced through the use of text, annotations, nicely crafted animations, or interesting and evocative views. Second, when the author’s intended narrative is complete, the user is put in charge and can actively explore the visualization following whichever path s/he considers most interesting."
A57,Storytelling in Information Visualizations: Does It Engage Users to Explore Data?,1,1,narrative visualization,"Segel & Heer report some results of the de-ployment of a narrative visualization (The Minneasota Em- ployment Explorer) [24], but the intent of the study was to create and measure social engagement in the annotation of data with personal stories, rather than personal engagement in the exploration of provided data. Although we agree with Segel & Heer that an author-driven scenario is likely to help users articulate initial questions for exploration, we question whether it is sufﬁcient for going “beyond those initial ques- tions in depth and unexpectedness” [18]. User-Centered Metrics and Behavior Measuring a user’s level of engagement in the exploration of data is a complex matter, specially when it comes to online mass-media. Acquiring the necessary qualitative information is impractical, if not impossible."
A57,Storytelling in Information Visualizations: Does It Engage Users to Explore Data?,1,1,narrative visualization,"Here, our goal is to see whether augmenting exploratory in- formation visualizations with initial narrative visualization techniques and storytelling can help engage users in explo- ration; we use low-level user-activity traces as signals, and we focus on analytic actions (which we refer to as semantic operations), and engagement—typically depth of interaction, which we interpret as the number of interactions a user per- forms that have a direct and perceivable impact on the display. CASE 1: THE CO 2POLLUTION EXPLORER In the rest of this article, we describe the design and results of our three ﬁeld experiments. For each, we created a speciﬁc exploratory visualization webpage with two versions: one that included an introductory narrative component, which told a short ‘story’ about the topic and context of the data, 2 Storytelling in InfoVis CHI 2015, Crossings, Seoul, Korea 1450 provided initial insights and unanswered questions, and in- troduced the different visual encodings; and another that did not. Each version, which we respectively refer to as the Sto- rytelling (ST) version and the no-ST version, was alternately assigned to new browser connections; returning connections were reassigned the same version using a Cookie."
A57,Storytelling in Information Visualizations: Does It Engage Users to Explore Data?,1,1,narrative visualization,"CONCLUSION In this article, we have shown that augmenting exploratory information visualizations with initial narrative visualization techniques and storytelling does not help engage users in ex- ploration. Nevertheless, our results are not entirely negative. The CO 2Pollution Explorer and the Economic Return on Ed- ucation Explorer were successful webpages that did engage people in a certain way: both received a relatively high num- ber of visits, and the average uptime was well-above web standards, whatever the version.

A59,Visualizing Interactive Narratives: Employing a Branching Comic to Tell a Story and Show Its Readings,1,1,narrative visualization,"Comics are a form of narrative visualization [29] and in fact derive from the earliest forms of visual communication [9,  18]. Whilst the study of comics has grown considerably in  recent years, theorists have struggled to keep abreast with  the technological advances that could impact the medium. Though user experience studies have previously been  applied to related hypermedia, the study of comics could  complement existing research by offering insight into the  impact of interacting with narrative visualizations upon  their comprehension. Subsequently, if there is an impact  upon how users ‘read’ these representations, this data could  provide insight into the impact interactions might have  upon the comprehension of other visual information. Previous work by Andrews et al. [3] integrated paper within  a multi-touch interface to explore theories of both comics  and interactive storytelling, and create an environment for  authoring and reading branching comics. It was argued that  comics are particularly useful for exploring interactive  stories, as they can be employed to visualize where and  how different interactive elements are embedded within a  story."

Throughout the analysis of case studies from online journalism, blogs, videos, and visualization research, the authors organized the design space of narrative visu- alization into three dimensions: genres, visual narrative tactics, and narrative structure tactics. Each dimension comprises resources that together aid the storytellers1in conveying a message. 1The term storyteller in this work means a designer building a narrative visualizationRegarding the first dimension, Segel and Heer [ 25] identified seven genres for narrative visualization: magazine style, annotated chart, partitioned poster, flow chart, comic strip, slide show, and film/video/animation. Essentially, they hold ways to organize and present information to viewers. They primarily vary in terms of the number of frames, i.e., the number of different scenes, how they can be applied to represent time and space, and the ordering of visual elements. By organizing the information differently in the space, these genres also influence how a user can explore a narrative."

A61,Chart Constellations: Effective Chart Summarization for Collaborative and Multi-User Analyses,1,1,data stories,"Dataset We collected several open datasets and data stories from Kag- gle, including the Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD) [glo17]. Thisis a large (~130 MB), multidimensional (135 dimensions), geo-graphic dataset stored in a tabular format (CSV ﬁle), catalogingmore than 170,000 terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970–2016.Popular datasets such as the GTD have hundreds of associated,publicly-available data stories. We recreated the data stories of 11 users (47 charts total) in our system as closely as possible. Our reasoning for this chart ensem-ble size is that we want to emulate a team of analysts in this casescenario (we felt that 11 was a reasonable count), and in our reviewof data stories on Kaggle we noticed that most site users createddata stories with between 3 and 6 charts. In addition, due to theperceptual scalability of hues used to color projected chart circlesin the Collab View, we are limited in the number of available val-ues (see Section 7.4). Note that Kaggle does not provide a keyword or hashtagging functionality; we manually add these by reviewingeach data story’s title, chart captions, and descriptions. 5.2. Use Case Scenario With the above ensemble set of visualizations, we now describe a use case scenario for Constellations.

Currently, Kaggle hosts over 5,600 opendatasets, contains over 250,000 Kernels, and has more than a mil-lion registered users [Gol17], making it the de facto standard for online data notebooks. Kernels is ofﬁcially described as a “collab-oration product ” [Mon16], but unfortunately the Kaggle website only allows for the selection and review of one Kernel at a time.This provides a real-world motivation for why a tool such as Con-stellations has value: it lets us simultaneously review and synthe-size a set of Kernels created by multiple users for a shared dataset. To support our study, we extended and implemented a Kernel interface which, for a set of users, presents their charts in a datanotebook format (see the Appendix for a screenshot)."

An ex-ample of this is the InterAxis system [KCPE16], which projectspoints values as a linear combination of data attributes bound to anaxis.

Liem1 , C. Perin2 and J. Wood1 1City, University of London, United Kingdom 2University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Abstract In the visualization community, it is often assumed that visual data storytelling increases memorability and engagement, making it more effective at communicating information. However, many assumptions about the efﬁcacy of storytelling in visualization lack empirical evaluation. Contributing to an emerging body of work, we study whether selected techniques commonly used in visual data storytelling inﬂuence people’s attitudes towards immigration. We compare (a) personal visual narratives designed to generate empathy; (b) structured visual narratives of aggregates of people; and (c) an exploratory visualization without narrative acting as a control condition. We conducted two crowdsourced between-subject studies comparing the three conditions, each with 300 participants. To assess the differences in attitudes between conditions, we adopted established scales from the social sciences used in the European Social Survey (ESS)."

Additional material: https://flowstory.github.io/attitudes/ . CCS Concepts Human-centered computing !Empirical studies in visualization; 1. Introduction Visual data storytelling is receiving a growing interest across academic ﬁelds and industries (e.g., [ SH10 , LRIC15 , Few17 , Den16 , Sch17 , RHDC18 ]). It now has dedicated conferences (e.g., Tapestry [ tap]) and conference sessions (at CHI [ chi], Info- Vis [ vis], OpenVisConf [ ovc]), competitions (e.g., PaciﬁcVis Vi- sual Data Storytelling Contest [ BLV17], Information is Beau- tiful Awards [ iib]), specialized departments in newsrooms (e.g., NYT [ nyt], NZZ [ nzz]), and publications targeting the business world (e.g., [ Dua10 , NK15 ]). Visual data storytelling is often said to make visualizations compelling, memorable, understandable, engaging, or persuasive (e.g., [ MLF12,Fig14a ]). However, from an empirical perspective, there is little evidence supporting such claims. Only a handful of studies have investigated these questions through controlled ex- periments that looked at the effect of visual data storytelling on memorability [ HDR13, BVB13, BBK16], at persuasive visual- ization [ PMN14, Mue12 ], at data anthropomorphizing [ BPE17], and at the relationship between storytelling and level of user- activity [ Dia10 , BDF15 ] or engagement [ MRL17]. No study has looked at the effect of visual-narrative techniques – the tools used in visual data storytelling to create narratives – on people’s attitude.Contributing to this growing body of work, we investigate to what extent selected visual-narrative techniques often used in vi- sual data storytelling inﬂuence people’s attitudes towards the con- tentious topic of immigration. We conducted two crowdsourced between-subject experiments with 300 participants each to com- pare (a) personal visual narratives designed to generate empathy; (b) structured visual narratives of aggregates of people; and (c) a fully exploratory visualization without the use of any visual- narrative techniques, which served as a baseline. We ran two ex- periments to account for the fact that prompting participants with questions about immigration before they were exposed to the stim- ulus might bias the results: in experiment 1 , participants were asked questions about immigration both before and after the stimulus (pre-post-test design), while in experiment 2 they were asked these questions after the stimulus only (post-test design). This single dif- ference between both experiments highlights the difﬁculty in evalu- ating the effects of storytelling: experiment 1 yields more power by comparing values before and after the stimulus; while experiment 2 avoids priming participants by not asking questions before the stimulus."

We further discuss the lim- itations of the methods commonly used to evaluate visual-narrative techniques in particular, and storytelling in general. 2."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"Background And Related Work Over the past two decades, there has been a growing interest in vi- sual data storytelling . Research on the topic includes high-level process models (e.g., [ CM11 , MLF12, LRIC15 ]), design space studies (e.g., [ SH10 , DKN11 , BLB17, SLRS16 , BRCP17 ]), de- scriptive frameworks and taxonomies (e.g., [ HD11 , nap, Rot]), im- plementations (e.g., [ ARL17,tim]) mainly describing the data sto- rytelling authoring perspective. Little prior research describes the audience perspective, including qualitative and quantitative evalu- ations (e.g., [ HDR13, Fig14a , BDF15 , MRL17]). Many contributions focus on the use and evaluation of visual elements and techniques such as pan, zoom, superimposition, wid- gets for interactions, navigational devices (e.g., stepper or stroller), and their practicability for visual data storytelling (e.g., [ GP01 , BLB17, SLRS16 , MRL17]). Complementary approaches evalu- ate the applicability of theories and techniques from classical narra- tive disciplines such as literature, comics and ﬁlm to visual data sto- rytelling (e.g., [ HD11 ,Fig14b ,AHRL15,BRCP17 ,Kos17 ]). In this paper, we follow the latter approach to assess the effect of two es- tablished narrative techniques (structure and empathy) in a visual- ization. Through this approach, we aim to reveal insights about the mechanisms of storytelling as a whole, thus expanding the space of visual data storytelling. We know that narrative techniques help create a story in a reader’s mind [ HJR10 ,Rya04 ]. While this is par- ticularly true in the context of literature and ﬁlm, this also applies to other media [ Rya04 ] such as still and moving pictures, music, and digital media – which includes visual data storytelling. Still, empirical studies are needed to assess the conjectural beneﬁts of narrative techniques in the context of visual data storytelling. 2.1. Related Controlled Studies in Visualization We now discuss previous studies that have assessed the effects of structure orempathy ; or that are related to attitude in the context of visual data storytelling. Visual-Narrative Techniques for Structure. A ﬁrst group of studies have looked at the overall structure and sequencing of visual narratives, showing that: delivery mode (author-driven vs. reader-driven, [ SH10 ]) has a small effect on participants’ story re- construction [ BW14 ]; that people create and prefer hierarchical structures for sequencing based primarily on space, and less on timeor measure [ HKL17 ]; that sequences with parallelism – repeating patterns of transition types – as a structural device are beneﬁcial for memorability [ HDR13]; that visualizations (compared to just text) and animated transitions (triggered through stepper buttons and scrolling) improve reader-perceived engagement [ MRL17]; and that the ability to re-watch and compare visual narratives based on data selections (e.g., location) facilitates understanding [ CRS20]. A second group of studies have investigated the effect of pro- viding structure through adding narrative sections to common vi- sualizations, showing that: adding visual data storytelling before exposing people to a visualization does not increase their activity levels and immersion [ BDF15 ]; that adding backstory narratives to crowdsourcing evaluations of visualization tools does not result in higher accuracy and attention and does not result in higher con- ﬁdence, enjoyability, perceived easiness and usefulness [ DBD17 ]; and that asking quiz questions to structure an exploratory stimulus encourage people to interact more [ Dia10 ]. A third group of studies have looked at the effect of visual struc- ture, showing that: the use of human-recognizable objects such as pictograms, may enhance memorability, comprehension, and re- call [ BVB13, BBK16]; and that animated pictograms lead to higher viewer engagement than static standard charts, which, how- ever, have the same or a higher viewer engagement than static pic- tograms and animated standard charts [ ARL18]. Visual-Narrative Techniques for Empathy. To date, only Boy et al. [ BPE17] and Concannon et al. [ CRS20] have investigated empathy."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"This calls for additional studies investigating new effects and conditions in visual data storytelling. The inﬂuence of visual-narrative tech- niques on people’s attitudes has not been studied yet, although at- titude has been used as one of the measures to determine persua- siveness [ PMN14, Mue12 ]). We explain in the next section how people’s attitudes are subject to variation when exposed to stimuli, making attitudes a promising dimension to study. 2.2. Values, Attitudes, and the European Social Survey To explain why and how we looked at the effect visual data story- telling can have on attitude towards a sensitive topic, and why we looked at immigration in particular, we ﬁrst describe human values andattitude .Human values aregeneral principles in life, or basic broadly immutable beliefs, that inform more mutable attitudes and opinions [DM12 , O’K16 ].Attitude refers to an individual’s eval- uative judgment about a stimulus object, which can be anything that is liked or disliked (e.g., individuals, groups, events, prod- ucts and abstract concepts) [MH15 ]. While values are quite stable over time, attitudes can be inﬂuenced in various contexts and situ-ations [ DM12 ]. This makes attitude a good measure to study, given that it is more inﬂuenceable. Human values and attitudes have been collected and analyzed by the European Social Survey (ESS) across Europe since 2002 [ JRFE07 , essb ]."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"Experiment Rationale and Materials To investigate the effect of visual-narrative techniques used in visual data storytelling on attitude, we selected an immigration dataset. Selecting a topic to study changes in attitudes is challeng- ing. We chose a topic that it is close to life and for which peo- ple tend to have strongly held attitudes, intending to obtain more meaningful results than if we were to use a topic for which peo- ple tend to have weak attitudes. Indeed, while the latter category of topics would likely lead to a larger variance in observed attitude changes, it would also yield less interesting results and open up to the criticism of testing the obvious."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data stories,"Discussion In this section, we interpret these unexpected results and discuss possible explanations as well as implications for the design of vi- sual data stories and for research in this area. 5.1. Can Anthropomorphism Elicit Empathy? Result 1 shows a small but signiﬁcant average change of immigra- tion attitudes in the empathy condition. While this meets our expec- tation regarding Hempathy , the results of experiment 2 overall did not conﬁrm this effect."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"This contradiction together with the small effects observed is the second attempt after Boy et al. [ BPE17]’s study that fails at clearly demonstrating the beneﬁts of designing for empathy in visual data storytelling. That stands in contradiction to our common and reasonable belief that empathy in visual data storytelling might affect viewers of the visualization. It might be that using anthropomorphized data graphics does not trigger empathy as expected; but it might also be, with a narrower implication, that empathy does not inﬂuence people’s attitudes to- wards immigration in general. The exploratory analysis in regard to result 1 showed that different demographics tend to be more inﬂuenced by the empathy design than others."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"This calls for further studies of vi- sual data storytelling, anthropomorphism, empathy, and attitudes. 5.2. Could Structure Act Against Evidence-Based Understanding? We formulated Hstructure assuming that a view dependent on ev- idence rather than (potentially prejudiced) assumptions about im- migration might lead to more positive attitudes; and that a struc- tured navigation through the data might lead one to understand data-evidence more clearly; which would by transitivity result in the structure condition leading to more positive attitudes towards immigration. While results from experiment 1 go in the direction of this hypothesis in terms of perceived threat, the effect size is small."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"Nevertheless, based on our results, our study joins the grow- ing set of studies investigating the role of visual data storytelling that tend to ﬁnd small or unexpected effects when testing different visual-narrative techniques or visual communication modes. How- ever, the size of differences should be put in their context. Atti- tudes towards immigration are believed to be strong attitudes (re- search in attitude strength distinguishes between strong and weak attitudes [ MH15 ]). Consequently, it is unlikely to observe large ef- fects on these strongly held attitudes and small but notable effects, in this context, might be more important than they look."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,narrative visualization,"Since it is difﬁcult in practice to isolate the impact of visual narratives from the context around them, we, as a community, need to consider developing alternative approaches when assessing atti- tudes and beliefs in narrative visualization to the widely employed designs borrowed from highly controlled perceptual studies. For example, recent work [ NBS18 ] struck a new path by conductingmicro-phenomenological interviews, to target experience in visual data storytelling. The application of such or similar qualitative eval- uation approaches (e.g., case studies, focus group discussions, the use of additional media and narratives on the same topic) to the visual narratives presented, which include techniques such as an- thropomorphic elements or structured sequential revelations, can be a next valuable research contribution. 5.6. Limitations and Future Work As any study attempting to quantify some human characteristics, our work has several limitations. In both visual-narrative designs, we used text-based narration, which competes with other visual el- ements."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"Future ‘in-house’ experiments could make use of the audio channel to investigate ef- fects in multimedia data storytelling. In a world without monetary constraints, we could have imple- mented additional conditions. We could have created other designs using narrative techniques targeting the same categories as we used (structure and empathy) to conﬁrm our ﬁndings. We also could have included designs implementing narrative techniques that tar- get other categories [ RHDC18 ] (e.g., framing, argument, engage- ment/immersion) to test their inﬂuences on attitudes."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"With the ﬁrst study within our ﬁeld testing if different visual-narrative techniques can inﬂuence atti- tude, we contribute to improving our overall understanding of vi- sual data storytelling. We found no evidence to support our initial assumptions that empathy-evoking and structured narrative visual- izations could elicit more positive attitudes towards immigration than non-narrative displays. What we as a visualization community expect storytelling to afford is yet to be demonstrated empirically as the storytelling modes we investigated did not strongly inﬂu- ence people’s attitudes. Our results also have methodological im- plications."
A63,Structure and Empathy in Visual Data Storytelling: Evaluating their Influence on Attitude,1,1,data storytelling,"The ﬁeld of research con- cerned with visual data storytelling in particular, and visualization in general, is still in its early stages and many more studies need to investigate our often unchallenged assertions in this ﬁeld. We stress the need to gather more empirical evidence before making strong claims regarding the beneﬁts of storytelling in visualization – as it appears that beneﬁts that might have been demonstrated in other disciplines do not necessarily apply to the ﬁeld of visualization. These ﬁndings help to better anticipate the effects of narrative techniques used in visualization over people’s attitudes towards topics regarded as contentious and strongly held. We contribute new building blocks to the growing knowledge of storytelling in visualization, which can be used to design further experiments in- vestigating the use of visual-narrative techniques."

Introduction Multi-stage participatory races are competitions that last for several days where the contenders must cover a distance every day. They are quite popular in several sport disciplines such as motorsport rallies (e.g. the Dakar ), running (e.g. Jungle Marathon in Brasil), or cycling (e.g. the Tour de France , the Giro d’Italia orLa Vuelta )."

However, current visualization tools ei-ther lack support for storytelling or require signiﬁcant technical expertise. Informed by interviews with journalists,we introduce a model of storytelling abstractions that includes state-based scene structure, dynamic annotationsand decoupled coordination of multiple visualization components. We instantiate our model in Ellipsis: a systemthat combines a domain-speciﬁc language (DSL) for storytelling with a graphical interface for story authoring.User interactions are automatically translated into statements in the Ellipsis DSL."

Ellipsis consists of twocomponents: a JavaScript-based domain-speciﬁc language (DSL) provides a runtime for interactive narratives, and aweb-based interface enables direct-manipulation authoringof scenes, annotations and user interactions.

A65,Authoring narrative visualizations with Ellipsis,1,1,narrative visualization,"Related Work Research on narrative visualization has focused on how sto- rytelling techniques augment visualization as a communi-cation medium. Examining a hypothetical command-and-control exercise, Gershon & Page [GP01] list methods suchas setting the mood and place in time, and using redundantmessaging to reinforce information. Segel & Heer [SH10]analyze 58 narrative visualizations, identifying distinct gen-res and effective narrative devices such as tacit tutorials, se- mantic consistency andmatching on content. With Ellipsis, we seek to provide tools to support these narrative devices. c 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum c2014 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/cgf.12392 Arvind Satyanarayan and Jeffrey Heer / Authoring Narrative Visualizations with Ellipsis Hullman & Diakopoulos [HD11] examine how narrative devices affect reader interpretation. After analyzing 51 on- line visualizations, they posit that rhetorical decisions occurat four editorial layers: data, visual representation, textualannotations, and interaction. We build on this work in Ellip-sis by treating visualization and narrative as layered yet in-dependently editable components. Through an analysis of 42narrative visualizations and subsequent experiments, Hull-man et al. [HDR 13] formulate a graph-based state model of narrative visualization, and provide guidance for designingtransitions between states. We introduce a compatible modelin which scene and scene transitions are ﬁrst-class entities. Most existing narrative visualizations are hardcoded to a single storyline. However, deployments of social dataanalysis systems such as NameV oyager [WK06], ManyEyes [VWvH 07] and others [HVW07, WHA12, WHHA11] indicate that some users are eager to explore datasets andshare their own data stories. Unfortunately, most collabora-tive visualization tools provide minimal support for reusingvisualizations and instead feature simple text comments on asingle visualization. With Ellipsis we aim to provide rich an-notation and control structures sufﬁcient for authoring com-pelling stories with pre-existing visualizations. Decoupled narratives must be able to modify visual- ization parameters, ideally without recourse to internalimplementation details."
A65,Authoring narrative visualizations with Ellipsis,1,1,narrative visualization,"Current Narrative Visualization Practices To understand how authors craft narrative visualizations, we conducted hour-long semi-structured interviews with twojournalism graduate students and two Knight JournalismFellows y. All respondents had signiﬁcant experience author- ing data-driven stories; their self-reported web developmentknowledge ranged from beginner to intermediate levels. yKnight Fellows are professionals awarded a fellowship to “foster journalistic innovation, entrepreneurship, and leadership.”Despite different working styles and expertise, all four respondents described a three-phase design process: explo- ration to uncover interesting stories in data sets, drafting to prototype ways of communicating the stories they found,andproduction to develop the ﬁnal interactive. Each stage of the process relies on different tools. In the exploratory phase,our respondents use tools such as Microsoft Excel, Tableauor R/ggplot2 [Wic09] to build static visualizations and dis-cover compelling stories."
A65,Authoring narrative visualizations with Ellipsis,1,1,narrative visualization,"A Model for Narrative Visualizations In this section, we present a set of storytelling abstractions for authoring narrative visualizations. Our model stems froman iterative process in which we reviewed prior work, in-terviewed representative users, and reimplemented existingnarrative visualizations. In particular, reimplementing narra-tive visualizations allowed us to identify recurring elements,and to explore the boundary between “narrative” and “vi-sualization” to gauge how much control a storyteller needsover the visualization to author compelling stories. We deﬁne a narrative visualization as a set of visual- ization components, control widgets and annotations thatare coordinated by a narrative state machine. The core ab-stractions in this model are state-based scenes, visualization parameters, dynamic graphical & textual annotations, and interaction triggers. We ﬁrst describe these elements, then show how they can be combined to construct narratives. c 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum c 2014 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.362 Arvind Satyanarayan and Jeffrey Heer / Authoring Narrative Visualizations with Ellipsis 4.1.

However, decoupling theimplementation of the visualization from the narrative struc-ture offers several advantages to the author while maintain-ing an integrated experience for a reader. First, decouplingenables a single storyline to coordinate independent visu-alizations and control widgets."
A65,Authoring narrative visualizations with Ellipsis,1,1,narrative visualization,"Textual and Graphical Annotations Narrative visualizations often include textual and graphi- calannotations to highlight important information and draw readers’ attention. Our model includes annotations as ﬁrst-class entities, which can be associated with a given visu-alization.

A65,Authoring narrative visualizations with Ellipsis,1,1,narrative visualization,"To effectively craft narrative visualizations, a storyteller must exercise visual design and communication skills. Asour understanding of the factors underlying effective nar-rative visualization matures, a question for future work isto consider how narrative visualization design tools mightencourage good design. How might we codify best prac- tices for narrative design? How might the resulting prin-ciples enable automated design assistance or enhanced in-teraction techniques?

Narrative visualization recommender is the solution to leave a memorable message followed by a pleasant experience, benefiting from interactive storytelling tactics [1]. However, the main obstacle that has been discussed in our previous work is to manage the system’s three main components: the extracted persona, the interactive visualization and the story generator, work together as a recommender system. Our conceptual paper is a good initiation, but more works is required to reach to a comprehensive solution.

ACM Classiﬁcation Keywords H.5.m. Information Interfaces and Presentation (e.g. HCI): Miscellaneous Author Keywords Narrative Visualization; Information Visualization; Design Space INTRODUCTION With the increasing amount of data generated by different sources, data visualization has become increasingly relevant to create visual representations that improve exploration, analy- sis and communication of such data. Thus, novel ways of data representation have been proposed in the academic ﬁeld and also outside this domain. Beyond the power of visualization to communicate information, facts and opinions, data visuali- zation researchers have begun to consider visualization as a medium to tell compelling data stories. Storytelling (which refers to the expression “to tell a story”), in the visualization context, can be deﬁned as an ordered se- quence of steps, with a clear deﬁned path. These steps can include many types of medias, such as texts, images, visualiza- tions, video or any of their combinations [27]. This strategy of integrating visualization techniques with storytelling enables ACM acknowledges that this contribution was authored or co-authored by an em- ployee, contractor or afﬁliate of a national government."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"For them, narrative visualization could help doing so, because it allows information to be revealed in an effectively way, “as if an audience was watching a movie. ” Since then, many works in this area have emerged focusing on different aspects [39, 41, 46, 24, 25]. In our study, we focus on narrative visualization [39] as a way of telling story with data. Whereas some researchers [39, 41] performed previous analysis of narrative visualizations from the industry1, we propose an analysis of narrative visu- alizations created in academic works under the design space lens. Our purpose is to understand this design space - the design strategies used in narrative visualizations - to enable the iden- tiﬁcation of ways to design clear and concise narrative visu- alizations. It is aligned with the grand challenges for HCI researchers [40] related to the topic “Accelerate analytic cla- rity”. Our main goal is to map the design space of narrative visualizations developed in the academic context. More speci- ﬁcally, our main contributions include: the analysis of which interface aspects the authors were concerned to report; the design space extension of the studied seminal works, by including the techniques used in academic works; the most explored design space components; discussion about some unexplored elements; and some initial research opportunities."

After that, we describe our methodology as well as the identiﬁed/proposed design space extension. Moreover, we summarize the use of design space (Design Space Analysis Summary) and, ﬁnally, we present our conclusions and point out some initial research opportunities. 1We consider as industry those narrative visualizations created out- side the academia. BACKGROUND In this section, we intend to discuss some topics that are related to our work. Speciﬁcally, we bring some concepts related to the area of data visualization, as well as to the area of narrative visualization. Data Visualization According to Ward [45], visualization can be deﬁned as the communication of information using graphical representati- ons, which provides an alternative or complement to textual or verbal information."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative Visualization The relationship between data visualization and storytelling is seldom articulated clearly, but many researchers have discus- sed this subject as well as ways to incorporate storytelling in visualizations [39, 41]. Narrative visualization is an expres- sion that Segel and Heer [39] used to refer to visualizations that incorporate storytelling into their design. They developed a framework that suggests design strategies for narrative visu- alization in order to prevent some difﬁculties when the user is given freedom and control over the narrative. According to Segel and Heer [39], narrative visualizations differ from traditional forms of storytelling in important ways. Formerly, data visualizations were used to support traditional forms of storytelling [14]. Nowadays, there has been a great effort to transform visualizations in an independent form of storytelling that can exist without the support of traditional forms of storytelling, such as video or text [17]. Figure 1: Reference model proposed by Card et al. [9]."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,storytelling with data,"To Figueiras [18], the combination of storytelling with data visualization has been pointed out as an efﬁcient way to re- present and make sense of data. Narrative elements in data visualization are able to provide explanation about the subject, and often support a structured interpretation form that usually does not exist in traditional data visualization. Diakopou- los [14] discussed an issue in the visualization area about how beneﬁcial or not it is to introduce storytelling in data visuali- zation. According to the author, if well done, storytelling can be a powerful way to create a structured interpretation path, because the way a story is presented to a user associated with the interactions afforded with the visualization will impact the possibilities of data exploration."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,data story,"In order to improve the deﬁnition of what constitutes a visual data story, Lee et al. [41] did a detailed description of the acti- vities, artifacts, and roles involved in the storytelling process in visualization (which is called here as data visualization with storytelling). They discussed a more encompassing look at the visual storytelling process to uncover open areas for research. The visual data storytelling process was proposed as a working model that can contain many loops and multiple occurrences of each component: exploring data, making a story, and telling a story. In Figure 2 we can see these components and the roles that visualization storytellers assume. This process involves transforming data into visually shared stories via exploring data, making a story, and telling a story, and the progression of these three components does not need to be linear. Figure 2: Storytelling process proposed by Lee et al. [41]."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Our work is an attempt to progress the research in this ﬁeld, charting the landscape of the current narrative visualization design space ans its possible extension. NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION DESIGN SPACE Visualizations elaborated with the intention of telling stories to their audience need to incorporate elements that would give them a ""story tone"". In literature, we were able to ﬁnd two works [41, 39] that analyzed several narrative visualizations, developed mainly from news web sites. Through this analysis, they identiﬁed some components that could be used to cons- truct such visualizations, forming what Segel and Heer [39] called ""narrative design space"". The narrative design space proposed by Segel and Heer [39] is composed by three categories: genre ,visual narratives and narrative structures . Firstly, genre is how the story is organi- zed."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"The authors also identiﬁed that narrative visualizations were in the spectrum of author-driven and reader-driven approaches, which are, basically, how much users can explore data, how many paths they can run and how interactive the interface is. The author-driven approach provides a linear ordering of scenes, heavy messaging and no interactivity, whereas the reader-driven one neither has a prescribed ordering, nor mes- saging, and has free interactivity. All examples in their dataset were a mix of both approaches (author and reader driven). The authors also present three hybrid models (that combine both approaches in different levels from one another), that emer- ged from their analysis: Martini Glass Structure, Interactive Slideshow , and Drill-Down Story ."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Different from Segel and Heer’s work, the authors restricted the analyzed corpus by including just narrative visualizations that provide a way for the author to specify the narrative ordering. The categories found by the authors were Communicating Narrative and Explaining Data , Linking Separated Story Elements ,Enhancing Structure and Navigation , and Providing Controlled Exploration . Communicating Narrative and Explaining Data is the tech- nique used to explain or provide some clues for the readers, using, for example, annotations or audio narration. Linking Separated Story Elements provides manners to connect ele- ments that are related in the story and which can be done, for example, through colors or interaction (highlighting some connected elements when one of them is focused)."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"METHODOLOGY Since this work aims to analyze narrative visualizations pre- sented by the academic community, we search works available in some of the main digital libraries (ACM digital library, IE- EEXplore digital library, Elsevier ScienceDirect, Wiley and Google Scholar). We included papers that encompassed - in the abstract, title or keywords - the terms “story”, “narrative” or“storytelling” and the words “visualization” or“visual”. From this initial search, we selected 71 papers that contained these mentioned criteria. Finally, we analyzed these 71 works and selected 25 that presented an implementation of narrative visualizations."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"CONCLUSION Narrative visualization is a research area that has been growing and receiving attention by the academia. Gershon and Page [20] were the ﬁrst researchers to notice that storytel- ling could contribute to information visualization. Their main contribution was to conceptualize the idea. In 2010, the to- pic appeared again with Segel and Heer [39], who stated that data stories are an emerging class of visualizations. They provided a typology for classifying visualizations and gene- ralized advice for designing narrative visualizations. In 2013, storytelling was pointed out as promising to open new ave- nues of visualization research, ranging from presentation to exploration and analysis [27]. Therefore, research focusing Figure 6: Complete list of design space visual narrative. The green color indicates the new genre found through our analysis, and, in orange, the ones that were found by Stolper et al. on storytelling in visualization can be considered as a recent research area, and we perceived that a story is a powerful abs- traction that can be used by data analysts to better understand patterns and data."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Previous works [39, 41] identiﬁed which techniques are being used in the design of narrative visualizations. In both works, the authors analyzed narrative visualization available, mainly, in news web sites. Differently, we analyzed works in the academic context, in order to identify the techniques used by academic researchers, and try to establish a parallel between the previous design space identiﬁed by these semi- nal works [39, 41] and the design space retrieved from the analyzed papers. By analyzing 25 works that were retrieved from some of the main digital academic libraries, we identiﬁed the techniques used by the authors, extended the previous design space with these techniques and identiﬁed unexplored elements of this design space, as well as some research opportunities. As research opportunities, we envisioned that it is necessary to understand storytellers’ needs and how they want to build narrative visualizations. Besides that, it is important to de-epen the studies concerning better ways to design narrative visualizations. Furthermore, Segel and Heer [39] mentioned in their work that genres work better for different story types, and they depend on the complexity of the data and the story, the intended audience, and the intended medium. They also mentioned that there are trivial genres that ﬁt better than others in some cases, such as the use of Slide Shows instead of Comic Strips, in the case of business presentation."
A67,Analyzing Design Strategies for Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Given the dimension of the design space, we understand that it is necessary to deepen the understanding of each design space category, through studies that focus on each one of them (similar to the work of Amini et.al [4], that focused on narrative visualization through videos, or the work of Hulman et al. [25], that explored ways to structure linear narratives, focusing on the Transition Guidance category). Besides that, we also point out that comparing studies between the items of each category, e.g., comparing forms to highlight information or different forms to make transition between the scenes, is also an interesting and important topic of study. For future works, we will further the study of visualization techniques associated to storytelling elements and conduct studies on data analysts’ needs regarding visualization. This study is part of other studies in progress that involve end-user development, narrative visualization, and data analysis.

In this article, we explore the structure and techniques of documentary film and how they apply to the practice of constructing narrative visualization with video. We review the structural aspects of documentaryfilm with examples relevant for narrative visualization. Using six of the highest quality video-based narrative visualizations, we conducted a study of user preferences for three pairs of videos. The video pairs were spe- cifically matched to highlight unique features available in documentary film. Using the preferences expressedby our participants, we performed an empirical study to examine the documentary features most valued by our participants."
A68,Documentary narrative visualization: Features and modes of documentary film in narrative visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Our results provide implications about the style and features of documentary film that are most useful in the construction of narrative visualization. Overall, this work provides a clear starting point forthe construction of documentary narrative visualization providing content creators with specific techniques that will improve engagement of their content. Keywords Documentary, narrative visualization, information visualization, video analysis Introduction NARRATIVE visualization refers to a style of informa- tion presentation that constructs data visualization– based stories using storytelling. Much of the extantresearch in this area has explored various aspects of narrative visualization including author/user-driven construction, rhetorical framing, story sequence, andmetaphor. 1–6The majority of this work has been an analysis of frame-based techniques in storytelling. This article explores the possibility of constructing narrative visualization with narrative techniques based on film.Emerging technologies are opening up a new range ofpossibilities for deeper and richer visual representation of data-driven phenomena using film techniques. For instance, YouTube, the popular video sharing service,attracted more than one billion monthly active usersby 2013, with monthly active users exceeding two bil- lion by 2020. 7,8YouTube is joined by Facebook,Snapchat, and Periscope in the provision of dedicated video applications.9YouTube, as an exclusively video- based platform, continues to be the most widely used online platform.10While all of these monthly active users are not necessarily attributable to the presenta-tion of data visualization, they do speak to a very strong trend of increasing content consumption using video-based user interactions. Previously, the presentation video has generally been regarded as a supplemental activity for engagingaudiences in a data-driven experience."
A68,Documentary narrative visualization: Features and modes of documentary film in narrative visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"At its core, documentary filmmaking is the combi- nation of evidence and rhetoric presented in a cine- matic medium.11This places documentary in a unique and perhaps solitary classification of film genre mostclosely aligned with the fact-based persuasive princi-ples of narrative visualization. The importance of fact-based presentation of the truth is rising to the surfaceas one of the most important conversations in narrative visualization. We recognize the ideals of accurately rep- resenting evidence as a noble and moral activity. 12Yet the process of visually encoding information includesmaking judgments about how to represent the data.The facts can remain the facts, as measurements of science, but once we begin to interpret and visually encode the facts, they become arguments, subject toour personal bias. 13Narrative visualization finds itself in a similar position with documentary on the narrativespectrum, positioning somewhere between objective news and emotionally inspired drama. 14In order to be effective, narrative visualization must combine ele-ments of both. Given these challenges, the principles used in the construction of documentary film can serve as a guidefor narrative visualization. The emerging study of truthand deception in narrative visualization parallels someof the earliest definitions of documentary film fromDziga Vertov’s ‘‘kinopravda’’ (film truth), to Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin’s ‘‘cinema verite’’(truthful cinema). 15The objective of these early film pioneers was to capture the most truthful and accurate repre-sentation of various phenomena. In a discussion on themethods of Sergei Eisenstein and Vertov, documentary scholar Bill Nichols explains that ‘‘Eisenstein’s theory of montage and Vertov’s ideas about editing insistedon the necessity for the filmmaker to juxtapose images,or shots, in many ways that jarred the viewer intoachieving new insights. 11’’ This analysis mirroring the holy grail of narrative visualization as a set of tech- niques organized for the purpose of identifying andcommunicating new insights. Jessica Hullman and others have written extensively about the use of information design elements as classesof visualization rhetoric imposing strategic influence orpersuasion on characteristics of the visualization inter-action, end user’s knowledge, and the socio-culturalcontext. 3,16In similar fashion, the use of rhetorical proofs completes the definition of documentary film through the deployment of ethical, emotional, anddemonstrative arguments that engage the feelings,human conditions, values, and logic of an audience. Documentary ¼Evidence þRhetoricDocumentary narrative visualization is the presenta- tion of a data visualization experience using the tech- niques of documentary film. Film making and narrative visualization share a common architecture with the two varying in a small degree of form. This small difference is fading with several examples of complex data visualizations being represented in short documentary videos. Researchers in data visualization have also turned an eye toward the potential of data visualization in film.17–19 This article is intended to instigate discourse on the disruptive impact of documentary film as a medium of narrative visualization. To this end we provide an over- view of the literature on the uses of data visualization in documentary film. We examine these issues with an empirical study of documentary narrative visualization. The study captures the preferences users express for various features of documentary film. We then high- light the features most relevant for the construction ofnarrative visualization. Specifically, we explore two main research questions: Q1.Do audiences identify the documentary film genre more closely with factual analysis than other filmgenres? Q2.Do audiences place value on the traditional fea- tures of documentary film? Documentary film From the earliest examples, documentary film has been organized to present evidence using dramatic and persuasive methods."
A68,Documentary narrative visualization: Features and modes of documentary film in narrative visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Documentary film and narrative visualization share this common approach. Modes of documentary Scholars of documentary film have defined and debated various forms of documentary. Notably BillNichols has defined a historical progression of the varying forms of documentary into distinct modes with their own characteristics. These modes includethe poetic, expository, observational, participatory, reflexive, and performative modes. 11In this article, we compare three modes of documentary film that areapplicable to the field of narrative visualization. Theexpository, observational, and participatory modes of documentary will compose the focus of our analysis. Expository documentary is the most complete form of documentary in terms of construction. Expository documentaries combine indexical evi-dence, voice of god commentary, narrative storytelling and rhetorical proofs in a visual film composition that acts to simulate or explain a particular reality."

Design of study We gathered a set of narrative visualization videos thatcontained features or narrative structure of documen- tary film. Each of the documentary film features and narrative structure tested in our study have been estab-lished historically in the literature on documentary film as important. Our study was designed to validate the utility of these features when they are used in doc-umentary narrative visualization. Specifically, the liter-ature on documentary film establishes at least six different modes including poetic, expository, observa- tional, participatory, reflexive, and performative. Ourstudy examined the following three modes: expository,observational, and participatory. These modes were selected because they contain a narrative structure that could be effectively structured in documentary narra-tive visualizations."

A qualitative review of the data narrative videos was performed to catalog theunique documentary features in each."
A68,Documentary narrative visualization: Features and modes of documentary film in narrative visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Participatory mode versus observational mode In a similar way, we compared the participatory modeof documentary with the observational mode with thedesire of gaining insight into the preference an audi- ence might have for the filmmaker being a part of a documentary narrative visualization.

This image of HansRosling was removed from the video leaving the data visualization only. The edited video is consistent with the definition standards of the observational mode ofdocumentary, with a camera turned on capturing events as they unfold."

How Mariano Rivera Dominates Hitters video, produced by the New York Times, is one of the most complete examples of docu-mentary narrative visualization videos constructed in the expository mode including each essential element of voice, indexical evidence, narrative storytelling, andrhetoric. 48 The video begins with voice of god commentary making a rhetorically persuasive assertion that ‘‘Mariano Rivera is one of the most dominant closers in history.’’ The pitcher’s skill in throwing one specificpitch known as a ‘‘cutter’’ is offered as the central piece of evidence for the claim. A series of animations con- taining indexical evidence is then presented. An ani-mation of the ‘‘cutter’’ pitch is used to present avisualization diagram of the lateral movement of the pitch keeping it off the sweet spot of the opponent’s bat. Another animated diagram is used to illustratehow the revolution of Mariano Rivera’s cutter pitch looks more like a fastball to the opponent, versus the resemblance of most pitcher’s cutter pitches that looksmore like a slider that can be easily identified from a spinning red dot."

The participants in our study affirmed documentary to be the genre of first selection when it comes to the identification of factual informa-tion and learning. Thus, the results of this research indicated that the answer to our first research question is yes—people do associate documentary films withfactual content more so than other genres.

Specifically, the comparison ofA Network Framework of Cultural History with Global Android Activations, Oct ‘08—Jan ‘11 provided a direct comparison of two documentary narrative visualiza- tions constructed in the observational mode, with very similar geomap data visualizations. When voice-of-godnarration was applied to either video, and it was com- pared to the companion video without narration, audi- ences preferred the video including the voice-of-godnarrative feature. This finding is likely generalizable to many documentary narrative visualizations that will accommodate communication with a voice-over narra-tive. However, future research should definitely explore this implication of our results. The comparison of the participatory mode with the observational mode of documentary narrative visualiza- tion, established a clear audience preference for having the filmmaker as a character in their own video.

However, existing short- form videos have heavily relied on textual information to express the underlying points, which lack thesupport of data visualizations. For example, commercial advertising videos introduce goods through sub-jective slogans, thereby leading to minimal persuasiveness.

The movement corresponds to the critical events of that period: Prime Minister calls a General Election—to be held on 8 June 2017. It can be seen that if we do not emphasize the #GE17 bubble, we may neglect this important election event. So we offer a way to understand the movement of these hashtags by focusing on the movement level.To reiterate, the movement level of each hashtag corresponds to actual events."

As an increasing proportion of online news can be construed as data journalism, we have witnessed a corre- sponding increase in the incorporation of visualization in article thumbnails. However, there is little research to support alternative design choices for visualization thumbnails, which include resizing, cropping, simplifying, and embellishing charts appearing within the body of the associated article. We therefore sought to better under- stand these design choices and determine what makes a visualization thumbnail inviting and interpretable."

Index Terms: Human-centered computing—Visualization 1 I NTRODUCTION We are witnessing a rise in data-driven storytelling and journal- ism [28]. News organizations are increasingly publishing articles across a variety of topic areas that are grounded in the analysis of data. Online news sites such as The New York Times’ Upshot ,The Pudding , and FiveThirtyEight are speciﬁcally devoted to publishing data journalism articles.

A71,Thumbnails for Data Stories: A Survey of Current Practices,1,1,data stories,"We conclude with a set of future research directions having a common goal of identifying best practices for designing inviting and attractive thumbnails for data stories. The main contribution of this paper are as follows: •Extracting the key characteristics of thumbnails by surveying a collection of in-the-wild thumbnails, •Deriving thumbnail design strategies and goals based on the survey and conversations with industry practitioners, and •Reporting the lack of consensus on design strategies and goals for visualization thumbnail designs. 2 R ELATED WORK We situate our work in relation to thumbnail design and to the use of visualization for communication, particularly in data journalism. 2.1 Designing Thumbnails Prior research shows that the presence of thumbnails in search re- sults help people locate articles of interest online [2, 10, 36], particu- larly when paired with informative titles, text snippets, and URLs. Thumbnails are a particularly important signal of relevance when some links to articles have them and others do not. Aula et al. [2] further showed that presenting thumbnails without accompanying text leads to worse search performance than simply presenting text without a thumbnail."
A71,Thumbnails for Data Stories: A Survey of Current Practices,1,1,data stories,"In regards to how they design thumbnails for data stories, these practitioners indicated that there are “ no hard and fast rules of thumb ” that can be applied to all cases. Aside from using a limited color palette to reinforce brand recognition, two of these practitioners admitted to avoiding the use of visualization in thumbnails. Instead, they opted to incorporate photographic imagery whenever possible, and that photos of people appear to drive more trafﬁc to articles. Maps also appear to successfully drive readers to articles."

We conducted a survey of visualization thumbnails and had a series of conversations with practitioners about the design of thumbnails for data-driven stories. Our study results reveal a design space for thumbnails, a set of thumbnail design components that can be leveraged to attract readers and help them to understand the main point and context of articles associated with thumbnails. We then asked six practi- tioners from news organizations to reﬂect on the use of thumbnails in their own organizations."

Pro- fessional and academic educational offerings typically focus on the computational literacies required, but professionals in the ﬁeld em- ploy many non-technical methods; sketching by hand on paper is a common practice. This paper introduces and classiﬁes a corpus of 101 data sketches produced by participants as part of a guided learning activity in informal and formal settings. We manually code each sketch against 12 metrics related to visual encodings, represen- tations, and story structure."
A72,How Learners Sketch Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"What cognitive models and design ideas do they bring to their ﬁrst sketches of data stories? How can those inform educational activities and tool design for novices in the ﬁeld? To tackle these questions, in this paper we analyze a sample of drawings made by learners as part of a “Sketch a Story” activity. The exercise focuses on helping novices learn how to quickly move from text data, to quantitative analysis, to a visual sketch of a story based on what they see in that data."

This can be grounded ﬁrst in existing conceptions of “visual literacy”. Kedra summarizes and deﬁnes this as the ability to understand and create meaning via visual stimuli [15]. Within this paradigm, the sketches produced by partici- pants in this activity exemplify translation (the transformation of text into image) and visual writing (the creation of meaningful images)."
A72,How Learners Sketch Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"In addition, work from Wang, et al suggests that conﬁdence, or ”self-efﬁcacy”, in sketching skills is a barrier to entering the practice of sketching effectively and compellingly when visualizing data stories [32]. Perhaps the most connected example of prior work on novices sketching data is from Walny, et al, who led participants through a sketching activity and assessed what they produced [31]. They created metrics to assess representations (from numeric to abstract) and hypotheses embedded in a small study of sketches. We extend and reinforce their work, while contributing a larger sample of sketches as another case study to deepen our understanding. 3M ETHODOLOGY Educators in the ﬁeld of data visualization and storytelling play a central role in introducing novices to common practices used byexperts [16]."
A72,How Learners Sketch Data Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"We classify and evaluate these sketches via qualitative data analysis against a set of metrics based on prior work in visual encodings, symbolic representations, and story structures. 3.1 Activity Design The Data Culture Project is a free toolkit of activities for introducing various aspects of data storytelling to learners, created by co-authors Bhargava and D’Ignazio. One of the activities is called “Sketch a Story” and introduces learners to quantitative text analysis and sketching with data. Our prior work discusses the design principles [3] and pedagogy [7] behind this activity. To summarize, the activity begins with introducing the idea of analyzing text as data and showcasing some infographic-style inspi- rational examples."
A72,How Learners Sketch Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"We call these ”data stories” because they build a narrative based on visual representations of data [19, 26].During the activity we emphasize that data stories can be seeded with simple, exploratory observations, such as ”Elvis Presley talks about love far more than Iron Maiden”. Facilitators check-in at regular points to ensure groups are moving from data selection, to identifying a story, to physically sketching together. The materials we provide typically include crayons or markers and large pads of paper, or whiteboard markers when large whiteboards are available. The sketches they create are shared via a feedback session where they brieﬂy introduce their story and have a lightweight response from the facilitator to connect common themes and resurface previ- ously introduced learning goals."

A72,How Learners Sketch Data Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"It would take further study and observation to make more conclusive statements about the underlying cause of this ﬁnding. 5C ONCLUSION Data storytelling isn’t simple – learning to ﬁnd stories in data andpresent them visually is a long process that involves mastery of multiple domains. Sketching is only one piece of the puzzle, but it is one practiced by most professional designers and one that can feel daunting to newcomers. It is critical to understand how learners start sketching as part of their growth as data storytellers, and this paper offers insight into some of the patterns seen in novice sketching in a guided introductory activity across a diverse group of participants. In this article we introduce a corpus of 101 hand-made sketches of data stories, created by a wide variety of learners in formal andinformal education settings, in-person and online, over the last 10 years. We classify the sketches against a set of 12 metrics in three categories - use of visual encodings, representational variety, andstory construction. We present and discuss our ﬁndings based onmanually coding the corpus against these metrics. We see strongevidence that learners can easily jump into sketching data stories, setting them up well to grow into a practice of sketching elements of data representations like many experts do. In future work we hope to explore why the learners made the decisions they did, and how they describe their own drawings. These ﬁndings contribute to our understanding of how learners begin to sketch data, and the ways in which they can be best sup- ported on that journey. While the speciﬁc constraints and prompts of this activity certainly have impact on the sketches produced, and limit the generalizability of the ﬁndings, our analysis of this corpus contributes a strong case study."

From a human -centred computing  perspective, the end- user’s  interpretation of these visualisations  is a critical challenge to design for, with empirical evidence already showing that ‘usable’ visualisations are not necessarily effective from a teaching and learning perspective. Since an educator’s interpretation of visualised data is essentially the construction of a narrative  about that student’s progress, we  draw on the growing body of work on ‘Data Storytelling’  (DS) as  the inspiration for a set of enhancements that could be applied to data visualisations to imp rove their communicative power. We  present a pilot study that explores the effectiveness of these DS elements based on educators’ responses to paper prototypes. The  dual purpose is understanding the contribution of each visual element for data storytelling, and the effectiveness of the enhancements when combined. The results suggest  that DS  elements could add clar ity, especially when there are multiple  possible stories in a complex visualisation.

A73,Towards Data Storytelling to Support Teaching and Learning,1,1,data storytelling,"These challenges are the motivation for examining Data Storytelling (DS), which refers to  techniques employing narrative components (e.g. structures, elements, concepts, plots) to tell a story grounded in data  [10]. Journalists have been using data storytelling to inform news  in an effective way by “combining narratives with interactive  graphics”  [9, 17 ]. Ryan  [14] and Knaflic [8] connect DS to   visualisation principles [20] (detailed in Sec. 2). Some research  has explored how DS principles can be used for information visuali sation in the communication of scientific data [ 11],  explaining dynamic networks through comic strips for an educational audience  [1], presenting “data stories” to a b roader  audience [ 17], or supporting presenters to tell a story through  data visualisations effectively  [8]. However, although these  works use various DS techniques, they have mostly b een  targeted at helping people present data more effectively to  engage an audience . Some work has started to be done towards  bringing these DS elements into the design space of automatically generated visualisations . For instance, some work  has been done to adapt visu al elements (i.e. emphasise text or  charts) depending on user’s cognitive ability to interpret a graph  [4]."

By weaving data into a story, the audience is  engaged through both – an objective and subjective perspective. A more convincingly communication of an idea or support for  decision making is taking place. One example of data storytelling  can be found through the famous Minard’s map of Napoleon’s  Russian campaign in 1812, which is discussed in many research  works related to visualisation [34]. Another example for data  storytelling is the research of business presentations, such  as ”storytelling with data”  in  of Knaflic’s works [15]. As we can  see, currently most data storytelling studies are building in a  utility context and serve a professional purpose such as businesses  or science. In simple terms, they refer to a context of ‘serious  storytelling’, as defined in [22]. Therefore, with this paper we try  to take a step forward, building a user-centred interactive data  storytelling framework. Within this paper, we present an  advanced solution of a previous prototype [21]."
A74,Designing a User-Centered Interactive Data-Storytelling Framework,1,1,data storytelling,"The framework utilizes new digital  media technologies into the data storytelling process, by  implementing a sample scenario on a 3D platform. Our interactive  3D prototype has been developed to underly our research work,  and is combining 3D elements in combination with 2D  illustrations. A sample screenshot is presented in Figure 1. Our framework focuses on interaction design issues, and  enables various interactive functions."

Basic Data Storytelling Framework     In this paper, we brief describe theories and methods that are  contributing to our framework, the basic idea of our framework,  the considerations in the designing process and some reflect in the  implementation of the prototype. The last section concludes with  a discussion about our findings, and especially emphasizes aspects  in user-cantered interactive data storytelling.   2 Related Works  Much research has been done in the domain of interactive  storytelling, as e.g. [1, 2, 7, 8]; more traditional works as e.g. [4, 6];  and the idea of serious storytelling [22] - just to state a few. Nevertheless, our data visualization framework is intersecting  multiple disciplines to create user-centered interactive data  visualization and adopts methods and theories from different  domains [38]. One of the main disciplines we are touching, is the more general  domain of ‘ visualisation ’. Much important research has been  done in this domain, and the most significant covering various  aspects of visualisation design can be found in [10, 11, 32, 34]."

When data visualisation is facing serious and profession users,  most theories (e.g. the data-ink ratio [33] – which is the ratio of  the un-erasable key visual element)  tend to the basic principle of  “Occam’s razor”[16] In short, the main aim while creating a  visualisation is to make it as simple as possible; delete  unnecessary details and elements; and attempt to achieve a high  communication efficiency to deliver the key data to the viewer. However, when the visualisation is targeted more towards  general audiences - which does not have the essential insights and   Designing a Data Storytelling Framework OZCHI'19, December 2–5, 2019, Fremantle, WA, Australia     understanding of the underlying data (maybe even not the  motivation to wanting to understand the data) – a more  sophisticating visualisation approach needs to be considered. The  approach should be more entertaining, needs to actually catch the  attention, and give them a reason to dig into the data. The idea to  converge serious utility with creating entertainment, artistic  expression, and ways to catch attention comes naturally. Such an  approach allows to deliver particular messages and knowledge  contained in a particular data set smoothly to an amore general  and non-domain expertise audience."
A74,Designing a User-Centered Interactive Data-Storytelling Framework,1,1,data storytelling,"Thus, we can consider this data storytelling as a way to ‘unpack’  the core messages included inside the data into a story by adding  narrative, to make dry data understandable in a more natural  form. Story telling as channel to transmit message is as a time  approved form of sharing information. We use stories to stories  to explain the world since thousands of years. A ‘story’ provides  an organic structure to carry information in a more appealing, and  encode data in a way which is easier to comprehend and  memorisable by humans."
A74,Designing a User-Centered Interactive Data-Storytelling Framework,1,1,data storytelling,"When weaving data into stories, we can  expect data storytelling to become a method which is smoother  and more efficient in communicating data to general audiences. However, increased complexity also raises the risk of wrong  interpretations and story interferences which will blur the focus  towards the key data. To prevent this affect, we are trying to  improve the overall data storytelling process through a careful  process in organising and visualising data and information, visual  encoding, and a more thoughtful process in creating narration. In  short, all these elements need to be covered by an overall data  storytelling framework. The user’s subjective properties will largely affect the  communication quality of the data when receiving an encoded  message. This is one of the challenges, when communicate data  utilizing data storytelling methods. Thus, it is necessary to take a  user-centred approach to put the user in the consideration  through several phases of the information organisation and  communication process. This extends towards several phases in  the design process, which all will have to be part of our developed  framework. Thus, a data storytelling framework needs to include an  information structure strategy, information units to visual  encoding mapping methods, and appropriate user-centred design  processes. In order to build up this framework, this research try  to bridge data visualisation method with principles from  communication, information theories, methods from art and  design, and aesthetics studies. Overall the aim is a data  storytelling which is attractive, fun and most importantly have  high efficiency in deliver the key data. Our approach of ‘data storytelling’ try to converge ideas  emerging from the fields of data visualisation, digital design, and  user-experiences to allow a smooth delivery of particular aspects contained in a data source to the viewer. Firstly, we analyse data  sources, and pack the data into a story to allow the delivery of the  mostly dry core message of the data in a more natural form. As a  next step, we apply theories from visualisation to create an  appealing visual form based on the raw data set.  4  Designing User-Centered Interactive Data  Storytelling Framework  Generally, a user-centered interactive data story is putting the  user in the center place. It also organises information based on in  a user-centred way, and is optimizing user experience by  delivering information efficiently. By weaving information  carefully through a careful selection of methods and principles  and interaction technics into the visualisation, we are able to  ensure an efficient delivery of the key meanings in the data  source.

The framework is composed of key-elements of  different disciplines as interaction design and user-experience  studies, media communication studies, aesthetics, data  visualisation, and storytelling. The goal of this work was to  provide insights how data can be visualised in a more appealing  and understandable way for humans. Our contribution with this  work relates to the following key-elements:   Information units as fundamental units to convey messages  contained in data sources;   The major design dimensions for interactive data storytelling  design;    Bridging of theories form different discipline into the context  of data storytelling;   Practical approaches to weaving data into a story. Nevertheless, the overall framework is currently in process, but  still requires additional research work, especially it’s innovation  value (e.g.[19]). We especially are preparing a user-study to  evaluate the validity of the framework, and test the prototype in  a more practical setting. This work will be conducted as part of a  follow-up study."

ABSTRACT Annotation plays an important role in conveying key points in vi- sual data-driven storytelling; it helps presenters explain and empha- size core messages and speciﬁc data. However, the visualization research community has a limited understanding of annotation and its role in data-driven storytelling, and existing charting software provides limited support for creating annotations. In this paper, we characterize a design space of chart annotations, one informed by a survey of 106 annotated charts published by six prominent news graphics desks. Using this design space, we designed and devel- oped ChartAccent, a tool that allows people to quickly and easily augment charts via a palette of annotation interactions that gener- ate manual and data-driven annotations. We also report on a study in which participants reproduced a series of annotated charts us- ing ChartAccent, beginning with unadorned versions of the same charts."

Segel and Heer [40] refer to this form of storytelling as nar- rative visualization, and in their proposed design space of narrative visualization, they indicate the importance of textual and graphi- cal annotation as well as visual highlighting. Kosara and Mackin- lay [29] have also emphasized the importance of annotation and highlighting in visual data-driven storytelling, particularly in the context of live presentations. In an effort to scope visual data sto- ries, Lee et al. [30] emphasize the need of the intended message in stories and the role of written explanations or annotations that help the viewer capture the message. They also identify that, to make it easier to tell data-driven stories, it is useful to support the easy creation of custom annotations through direct manipulation and reuse of existing story elements. Stolper et al. [41] identify seven common annotation techniques used to communicate narra- tive and explain data in popular data-driven stories."
A75,ChartAccent: Annotation for data-driven storytelling,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Our aim is to enumerate and realize the design choices in the annotation layer of visual data-driven storytelling. 2.2 Current Approaches to Annotation Many contemporary visualization tools provide limited annotation support, particularly in the domain of business intelligence [16]. Annotation functionality also features prominently in tools in- tended for collaborative visual analysis, such as ManyEyes [44], sense.us [25], and CommentSpace [46], as the ability to annotate a chart allows people to share their insights with others. In the follow- ing, we give further consideration to tools that support data-driven or data-aware annotation, and to annotation support in interactive visualization authoring tools. Data-aware annotation: In the context of visualization, annota- tion can mean more than the mere addition of textual and graph- ical elements to an existing chart."
A75,ChartAccent: Annotation for data-driven storytelling,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Finally, we constrain our scope to visual channels of communication. 3.1 Survey of Annotated Charts There is an abundance of annotated visualization artefacts that could help us identify a design space for annotation in the context of visual data-driven storytelling. Annotated charts can be read- ily found in scientiﬁc publications, journalistic media, information graphics, as well as in government and organizational memoran- dum [6]. These charts also appear in the context of live presen- tations [29], such as those delivered in educational or conference settings, where the speaker can elaborate further upon the charts and their annotations. Our survey was motivated by the analysis of a corpus of such presentations from the “Quantiﬁed Self“ or personal data tracking community; Choe et al. documented how quantiﬁed selfers visu- ally presented their insights, which included a discussion of anno- tation [14]."
A75,ChartAccent: Annotation for data-driven storytelling,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"As the motivation for this paper pertains to visual data-driven storytelling, we are most interested in the com- municative purposes of annotation. Dimension 1: Annotation Form Many deﬁnitions of annotation tend to imply that an annotation is merely text commentary that has been added to a document; we ﬁnd such deﬁnitions to be too narrow. According to Marshall [33], an annotation can be any kind of superstructural element added to a document, and her study of students’ marginalia in textbooks sug- gests that annotations can take many forms beyond mere text. In 232 the visualization literature, annotation is a “layer of user assistance and user insight” [28], a single annotation is regarded abstractly as meta-information related to some data, and the annotation is rep- resented with a visual object [19]."
A75,ChartAccent: Annotation for data-driven storytelling,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"To assess post- deployment adoption, we plan to monitor usage as well as collect and analyze the annotated charts people created with ChartAccent as a way to understand how people use ChartAccent, what they an- notate, and how we can further improve the annotation experience. 7 C ONCLUSION In this paper, we reﬂected upon annotation in the context of vi- sual data-driven storytelling. To provide empirical knowledge on the spectrum of annotations used in data-driven storytelling, we characterized a design space of annotation informed by a survey of 106 annotated charts. Using this design space, we designed and implemented ChartAccent, a tool that provides support for manual and data-driven annotation. ChartAccent provides a novel way of deﬁning and using data-driven annotations, and we envision that our annotation interactions can be integrated into other charting environments. To evaluate the experience of creating annotations with ChartAccent, we found that most participants could easily re- produce a series of previously annotated charts using ChartAccent after a short tutorial and practice session."

Many researchers have looked into means to identify and combat misinformation in text or data visualization. However, there is still a lack of under-standing of how misinformation can be introduced when text and visualization are combined to tell data stories, not to mention how to improve the lay public’s awareness of possible misperceptions about facts in narrative visualization. In this paper, we ﬁrst analyze where misinformation could possibly be injected into the production- consumption process of data stories through a literature survey. Then, as a ﬁrst step towards combating misinformation in data stories, we explore possible defensive design methods to enhance the reader’s awareness of information misalignment when data facts are scripted and visualized. More speciﬁcally, we conduct a between-subjects crowdsourcing study to investigate the impact of two design methods enhancing text-visualization integration, i.e., explanatory annotation and interactive linking, on users’ awareness of misinformation in data stories. The study results show that although most participants still can not ﬁnd misinformation, the two design methods can signif- icantly lower the perceived credibility of the text or visualizations. Our work informs the possibility of ﬁghting an infodemic through defensive design methods.

A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,narrative visualization,"However, few studies are concerned with how misinformation can be introduced in narrative visualization. One popular form of narrative visualization as presented in Fig. 1 consists of rich text providing contextual information and some key piece(s) of fact expressed by data visualization [33]. It is commonly known as illustrated text [55] (also magazine style [51]). While existing research efforts on nar- rative visualizations mainly concern facilitation of its creation [52], *e-mail: cb.zheng@connect.ust.hk †e-mail: mxj@cse.ust.hk Figure 1: (A) [40]: Narrative visualizations combining rich text and visualizations in online mass media. (B) [1]: Combine text and visualization to tell stories on social media there is a pressing demand for in-depth understanding of how prob- lematic design can mislead readers and bring misinformation. Moreover, there lacks effective methods that can help lay public stay aware of misinformation in narrative visualizations. Previous works have explored how to uncover visualization mirage in visual analytics process [37] and how to reveal and repair chart errors [7]. Nevertheless, the interplay between text and visualization in nar-rative visualizations is rarely considered. A common approach tocombat misinformation is performing automatic or manual fact-checking [56]."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,narrative visualization,"While the number of fact-checking services and algorithms for textual information is growing rapidly [56], not many of them could efﬁciently and cost-effectively detect misinformation in narrative visualizations. Facing the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we be- gin by asking, “How might misinformation be introduced intonarrative visualization?”. To this end, we ﬁrst conducted a lit-erature survey and derived a pipeline that describes the data sto-rytelling production-consumption process. Then, we analyzedevery stage of this data storytelling pipeline to identify possi-ble causes of misinformation and then grouped these causes intothree categories: author-induced reader-undetectable misinforma-tion (AIRUM), author-induced reader-detectable misinformation (AIRDM) and reader-induced misinformation (RIM). Next, we proceed to explore possible methods to combat misin- formation. Countering AIRUM and RIM might involve moderating the behavior of authors and readers of data stories [15, 37], whereas mitigating AIRDM could be achieved by better scrutinizing the pre- sented data stories. We thus focus on AIRDM in this paper. Besides, as the ﬁrst step towards combating misinformation in data stories, we focus on the magazine-style of narrative visualization, which is popular in journalism [57]. We target two typical issues for the magazine style under AIRDM : (1) deceptive visualization [45], and (2) text-visualization misalignment [27]. As discussed above, there are still technical barriers to detecting misinformation in data stories. As an alternative, we are interested in exploring whether there exist some defensive design methods to enhance people’s awareness of misinformation, which can prevent readers from falling for problematic data stories in the ﬁrst place. 1412022 IEEE 15th Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis) 2165-8773/22/$31.00 ©2022 IEEE DOI 10.1109/PacificVis53943.2022.000232022 IEEE 15th Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis) | 978-1-6654-2335-9/22/$31.00 ©2022 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/PACIFICVIS53943.2022.00023 Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data story,"This idea is inspired by the fact that different framing of the narrative visualization can result in different interpretations towards the same data story [22]. Previous studies show that relying on one-sided information to understand data stories may partially result in the unawareness of deceptive visualizations and text-visualization mis- alignment [27, 31]. Motivated by this observation, in our study, we considered candidate design methods that can enhance the integra- tion of text and visualization, thus balancing readers’ interaction with textual and visual information. To this end, We choose two commonly used and easy-to-promote design methods: interactive linking and explanatory annotation [29, 30, 57]. Interactive linking (denoted as Linking in the rest of the paper) highlights the corresponding explanatory visual elements when se- lecting speciﬁc sentences or words in the text (e.g., Fig. 2(A))."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data stories,"Both candidates bridge text and visu- alization, two critical components to data stories, either statically (Annotation) or dynamically (Linking) and guide readers’ attention to regions of visualizations that are central to the storytelling. To evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced text-visualization in- tegration, we designed and conducted a crowdsourcing study on Amazon Mechanical Turk with 222 participants to measure whether Linking and Annotation can affect people’s awareness of misinforma- tion and perceived credibility of text and visualization. We carefully selected three data stories on popular topics that are ﬂooded withmisinformation as study materials. For each story, we edited the original material to inject one piece of misinformation using one of the three methods identiﬁed in previous research: truncated axis (a case of deceptive visualization), inverted axis (another instance of de-ceptive visualization), and text-visualization contradiction (a kind of text-visualization misalignment) [27, 45]. Our experimental results showed that Linking and Annotation do enhance readers’ awareness of misinformation and signiﬁcantly lower the perceived credibility of the text or visualizations in the corresponding stories. However, we also noticed most participants are still unaware of misinforma- tion."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,narrative visualization,"Different from previous research, our work focuses on misinforma- tion occurring in the production-consumption process of data stories and explore design alternatives to combat misinformation that come from information misalignment. 2.2 Narrative Visualization Visualizations have been widely used to tell stories about data. Se- gal and Heer [51] introduced the term “narrative visualization” to cover such type of visualizations. Despite the varieties in genres, narrative visualizations generally combines (textual) narratives with interactive graphics [51]. Prior research around narrative visualization can be divided into three categories. The ﬁrst type of research focuses on exploring the design space of a particular genre or aspect of narrative visualiza-tion. For example, Bach et. al [2] conclude design patterns fordata comics. The second type of research seeks to develop algo-rithms and systems to facilitate the authoring process of narrative visualizations."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data stories,"Examples include Calliope [52] which automatically generates data stories from spreadsheets. Kong et al. [28] also pro- posed a crowdsourcing-based method to create interactive articles. The third type of research investigates factors that inﬂuence readers’ experience to motivate better design of narrative visualizations. For instance, McKenna et. al [36] look into how the reading ﬂow of data stories affects readers’ engagement. Our work is close to the last type of research and aims to investigate factors that might inﬂuence readers’ awareness of misinformation in data stories. We are particularly interested in factors concerning narrative visu- alization design. Given the considerably large design space, Hullman and Diakopoulos [22] have proposed a framework to analyze what can affect users’ interpretation of narrative visualization, which con- sists of four editorial layers, i.e. data, visual representation, textual annotation and interactivity. Among them, design techniques applied on the annotation and the interactivity layers can promote reader’s digestion of the story content and assist in awareness building by enhancing the connection between text and visualizations within a data story [47]. For example, Kwon et al. [29] propose a technique 142 Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Downloaded on July 19,2023 at 07:43:48 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,narrative visualization,"They found slideshow layout with linking can improve readers’ recall of and engagement with a narrative visualization. Wang et al. [55] compared different narrative visualization types and found increasing text-visualization integration can promote reader’s understanding. Our study focuses on two design methods to connect textual and visualization compo- nents in data stories, i.e., Annotation and Linking. Both of them are commonly used in designing magazine-style narrative visualization. Moreover, there exist fast algorithms [28, 30] to implement these two design methods, which make them easy to promote. 3M ISINFORMATION IN NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION McNutt et al. propose a pipeline of visual analytics to investigate how errors generated in each phase may undermine messages con- veyed in the ﬁnal visualization [37]. We are inspired to adopt a similar approach to obtaining a comprehensive view of the relation- ships between critical narrative visualization creation steps and the types of misinformation that can be introduced to mislead readers. To this end, we ﬁrst construct a pipeline that dissects the production- consumption process of data storytelling (covered in subsection 3.1) and then conduct a literature survey to identify possible sources of misinformation (following the deﬁnition in subsection 2.1) at each stage of the pipeline (detailed in subsection 3.2). 3.1 Data Storytelling Process Our pipeline is mainly adapted from Lee et al.’s visual storytelling process [33] while also motivated by previous works about visual analytics [8, 37]. As we are more concerned with how possible falsiﬁed information injected in the production-consumption process and lead to readers’ misperceptions of facts, we follow McNutt et al.’s [37] practice and omit complex cycles and nested sub-process [8, 33] to enable easy tracing of the origin of misinformation. Our pipeline describes the path from raw data to the perceived message by ﬁve main steps, namely, Analyzing, Visualizing, Script- ing, Arranging, and Reading (see Fig. 3). We further conceptualize the production process as steps involving authoring actions and the consumption process as steps of which the output will be directlyperceived by readers."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data story,"In this step authors determine what to tell (and not to tell) in the ﬁnal data story. Visualizing characterizes the process that authors create charts to visually communicate the complied data facts to readers [37]. Note that the charts here refer to the graphics readers actually see in the ﬁnal data story, not the ones that are used to analyze the raw data. Scripting indicates the process that authors organize multiple data facts and their corresponding charts into a certain narrative structure, including ordering, designing interaction, and messaging [51]. The goal of this stage is to combine the scattered fragments of facts into a complete story to convey author-driven narratives [22, 34, 51]. Arranging indicates the process that authors lay out multiple pieces of texts and/or charts in a scene and build the visual narrative ﬂow for the readers [8, 36]."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data story,"Note that Arranging is concerned with the format of the data story but not the content. Reading indicates the process that readers decoding information of the data story including the text and visualizations. The ﬁnal message that readers derive is a result of the interplay between the presented information of the data story and their inherent knowledge, purpose and beliefs [6, 17].3.2 Where does Misinformation Come from? By searching for related publications in TVCG, CHI, and other rele- vant venues, we synthesize in detail 17 number of the most relevant literature. We identify possible misinformation causes in every step of the pipeline proposed above from the literature. We present these causes and corresponding literature in Table. 1."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data story,"Readers with external knowledge about the data story and its context might be able to ﬁnd such AIRUM; however, it cannot be corrected based only on the information provided by the authors. Author-Induced Reader-Detectable Misinformation We de- ﬁne AIRDM as miscommunication rooted in the production process but can be detected by careful readers. Such misinformation might concern Visualizing, Scripting, and Arranging steps as the intersec- tion of the production and consumption processes illustrated in Fig. 3. Authors’ decisions in these steps are directly reﬂected in the output, and skeptical readers can spot the misleading elements."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data story,"As for mitigating AIRDM, a plausible approach is presenting the data story in a way that allows readers to scrutinize it easier [49]. Therefore, in the scope of this paper, we focus on AIRDM and conduct a crowdsourcing study to explore whether different narrative visualization designs may affect readers’ awareness of such misinformation. 4S TUDY DESIGN We designed a crowdsourcing user study to explore the possible ef- fects of two widely-used design methods in narrative visualizations, explanatory annotation (Annotation) and interactive linking (Link- ing), on readers’ awareness of misinformation in data stories. The misinformation we tested in the study is the type of author-induced reader-detectable misinformation. More speciﬁcally, two types of deceptive visualization [45] and one type of text-visualization mis- alignment [27] were used. 143 Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

In the selection process we took several factors into careful consideration. Most importantly, wefocused on topics like health and climate changes where misinfor- mation prevail [9, 11, 49]. Then, we chose interesting and relevant stories to motivate reading."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,narrative visualization,"We also need the original data behind the stories to ensure the feasibility of embedding misinformation into the selected narrative visualization. After several rounds of careful screening and discussions, we ﬁnally selected three short stories from three articles for our study: •COVID-19 story1: it presents the changes of infected cases during the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil from June 2020 to January 2021 using a line chart . The text refers to the vi- sualization to explain public policies, like reopening tourist attractions, adopted by the Brazil government. •Obesity story2: it stresses that obesity has become a critical risk factor for increasing mortality, by comparing the signiﬁ- cance of obesity as a cause of death to other risk factors like smoking in a bar chart . •Carbon Emission story3: it argues that developing countries shouldn’t rely on fossil fuels for development as what the developed countries have done in the past. A bar chart is used 1https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/ameri cas/brazil-coronavirus-cases.html 2https://ourworldindata.org/obesity 3https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/01/clima te/us-biggest-carbon-polluter-in-history-will-it-walk-aw ay-from-the-paris-climate-deal.htmlto compare the per person carbon emissions (metric tons CO2) of several countries in 2014."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,narrative visualization,"We then reproduced the narrative visualizations. As the three stories’ original text formats and layouts differ greatly, we uniﬁed their styles in our reproduced version by referencing online article styles in New Y ork Times. For visualizations, we only included elements concerned with the text we used in the study to avoid noise. This process resulted in a line chart for the COVID-19 story, a horizontal bar chart for the Obesity story, and a vertical bar chart for the Carbon Emission story as in Fig.4."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data story,"However, the deceptive visual elements in Truncated Axis and Inverted Axis make it more challenging for readers to ﬁnd the misinformation.As mentioned above, the text component of each data story con- tains a single sentence that explicitly states the misinformation. Al- though the misleading sentence is only part of a complete data story, it is central to the conveyed message, either to convince readers that the epidemic is under controlled (COVID-19 story), or to lower the dangerous of obesity (Obesity story), or to exaggerate China’s negative impact (Carbon Emission story). Besides, we assign each misinformation to a speciﬁc story to avoid ﬁnding it too easy. For example, suppose we inject Inverted Axis to the Obesity story and rank the number of death caused by air pollution higher than that by high blood pressure. In that case, readers can ﬁnd the misinformation easily by common knowledge."

The order of stories and the assignment of conditions were counter-balanced among participants. The participants could spend as much time on each story but no shorter than 30 seconds (mandatory minimum viewing time). Note that after reading each story, we did not ask participants to report detected misinformation because we didn’t want participants to look for misinformation on purpose in subsequent stories."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data stories,"Thus, we asked participants the level of consistency between the content of the story and their prior knowledge in seven-points likert scale to analyze the inﬂuence of prior knowledge to the results. 5R ESULTS 5.1 Awareness of Misinformation To investigate whether participants were aware of the misinforma- tion in the given data stories, we coded participants’ responses tothe questions in the story revisiting and fact-checking phases (seesubsection 4.5) and labeled their level of awareness based on the following criteria: 1.Participants who stated ﬁnding the misinformation in the story revisiting phase and also gave the right sentence that contains that misinformation were labelled as “fully aware”. 2.Some participants did not imply in the story revisiting phase that they found misinformation but in the fact-checking phase reported to have noticed the misinformation. For example, “I did see that inconsistency between the text and the visual- ization, but did not compute that it was an error , which waswrong of me ”. We labeled such participants as “ somewhat aware ”, if there exists evidence indicating that they hold rea- sonable suspicion. Such evidence includes but is not limitedto doubting (certain part of) the chart in their replies to the story-summarization questions, giving low credibility ratings (≤4) in the perceived credibility questions, etc. 3.For any cases other than 1 and 2, we label them as “ unaware ”."

In this section, we present our ﬁndings deriving from analysing participants feedback. 5.2.1 Does the perceived credibility differ? We perform MANOV A tests to investigate the impact of condition (Static, Linking, and Annotation) on the two sets of credibility scores (for text and visualization respectively as mentioned in subsection 4.6, also see Table. 3). Across different forms of misinformation, we could see that the condition has a signiﬁcant effect on the credibility scores (Approx."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data stories,"The above results show that Annotation and Linking can lower the perceived credibility of the data stories that contain misinformation. Worth mentioning, under all three conditions, the average text and visualization credibility scores across different misinformation lean to be positive (above 4). This result is consistent with Sec. 5.2.1, where most participants did not report any (valid) misinformation. 5.2.2 Compare the two types of perceived credibility We compared the credibility scores of text and visualization using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for each type of misinformation. Kong et al. [27] found that for visualizations with title-visualization mis- alignment, people consider the visualization to be more credible than the text."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data story,"Participants also identiﬁed text as an important factor that affects their understanding of the data story (“Excessive trust in text” in Table. 4 ). This ﬁnding is consistent with the claim of Kong et al. [27] that text has a strong power in manipulating the receiving information of data stories. Even though some participants sensed something might go wrong with the chart, they did not consider it as misinformation: “I saw that the text and chart didn’t match, but I assumed the text was correct and the chart had been printed wrong”. Misinterpretation of the visualizations is another reason. For example, some participants failed to decode one dimension of the data points: “The problem here is seeing where the line points match the date along the x-axis."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,narrative visualization,"We discuss the design implications from these reasons in Section 6. 6D ISCUSSION 6.1 Combat Misinformation from Narrative Visualization In this paper, we ﬁrst explore the possible ways that narrative visual- ization can bring misinformation in its production and consumption process. As suggested by Correll and Heer [13], “we should enu-merate the ways that visualizations can deceive or mislead.”. Our work is a ﬁrst step towards analyzing the space of misinformation in illustrated data stories.

A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,narrative visualization,"While there exist studies aiming at understanding the inﬂuence of layout or sequence on narrative visualization [2, 23], few of them concern misinformation. Hence, more works are needed to deepen our understanding of misinformation in data storytelling. The results of our crowdsourcing study suggest that the two common-used design methods, Annotation and Linking, can raise participants’ awareness of misinformation. We also found these two design methods can affect the perceived credibility of text and visu- alizations. However, the effects observed in our study look limited as most participants cannot ﬁnd misinformation in the given data sto-ries."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data stories,"By adopting other attention-guiding methods to nudge readers reading data stories comprehensively and skeptically (e.g., explicit warning [32]), we can have solutions to “Inattention to ele- ments related misinformation”, the most important cause identiﬁedin our study for being unaware of misinformation. Worth mentioning, the two defensive design methods we chose as conditions in the experiment (Annotation and Linking) can be automatically applied to many data stories using existing technolo- gies [28, 30]. With that said, we envision a possible future to defend misinformation: story or news release platforms, such as New Y ork Times, can automatically transform the uploaded data stories from authors into a form that contains some defensive design methodsand then release the stories to the public. In that sense, the plat- form can establish a protective barrier in content dissemination from authors to readers. Even if advanced algorithms cannot detect mis- information, readers will still have the opportunity to be aware of misinformation. 148 Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Visual Design to Guide Attention Most participants in our ex- periment attribute their failure to ﬁnd misinformation to their inat- tention (Table 4). Pennycook et al. [46] postulate that directing people’s attention to the accuracy of news can be a promising way to combat misinformation. Consistent with this insights, our results indicate that a promising design direction is to lead readers to attend to the part(s) of stories where misinformation is prone to appear."
A77,Evaluating the Effect of Enhanced Text-Visualization Integration on Combating Misinformation in Data Story,1,1,data story,"Empirical evidence implies that whether textual descrip- tion is closely linked to the data can affect reader understanding of the data story [39]. A data-oriented narrative style of text, such as emphasizing the data source, clearly expressing the analysis method of the data, and more accurately specifying the visual elements of the discussion, may facilitate readers’ judgment of the facts [41]. Knowledge-Augmented Visualization Some participants be- lieve that the reason why they do not discover misinformation is a lack of understanding of visualization or the background of the story (“Lacking Prior Knowledge” in Table 4). A feasible way to address this problem is to augment the original narrative visualization with external knowledge. Similar ideas have been applied to improve awareness of diverse social opinions [18]. 6.3 Limitation and Future Work Our study bears several limitations. First, we conducted experiments on three types of misinformation covering only two of the many causes of misinformation we identiﬁed in Table 1 (Break Conven-tions and Text-visualization misalignment ). Our study material is only concerned with two visualization types (i.e., bar chart and line chart)."

A videodeveloped by Google was selected as the baseline video (Control Condition; 2min 23s) due to its high quality and relevance to CTAs."

Some- times such misinformation is dangerous and even life-threatening (e.g., “Drinking bleach may kill the virus” [1]). Islam and his colleagues recommend that credible organizations such as “govern- ments and international health agencies continue publishing correct and context-appropriate information supported by scientiﬁc evidence about COVID-19 on their websites” [1]. The ways those organiza- tions deliver information is an important factor which still requires close investigation, however."

One of the greatest advantages of data sto- rytelling with video is that videos can introduce their contents in an organized sequence. This organized sequencing enables the viewers to process the data in a logical order along with the interpretations of data [2]."

Indeed, exploration of data might be somewhat intimidating and therefore, time-consuming for many people. Some might feelthey are lost in data, and hence, they may avoid exploring dataeven when they contain very important information [5]. Whiledata storytelling should be beneﬁcial [5 –7], presenting the data in a way that can be readily interpreted by laypeople with diversebackgrounds remains a challenge. In this paper, our exploration focuses on more than the cognitive aspect: With DVs, we explore the role of emotional responses in inﬂuencing the viewers’ perception. 2L ITERATURE REVIEW Data videos (DVs) are short animated graphics that tell stories that are based on factual data [4]. Given their brevity, ideally no longer than 6 minutes [3], and their entertaining and engaging nature, data videos are becoming very popular recently on platforms such as Y ouTube, TickTock and Snapchat [4]. For some people, data videos are becoming a primary source to get information on various topics."

We speciﬁcally explore the persuasive power data videos exhibit through their cognitivecontent (i.e., data and logical arguments), as well as the emotionsthey trigger in their viewers. The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion (ELM) is a dual process model that suggests two routes that can lead to persuasion (i.e., attitude and/or behavioural changes):central and peripheral routes [16]. When the receiver of a persuasive message is highly motivated about the topic, they are more likely to process the message through their cognition, using the mental clues in the message, while less motivated individuals would process themessage based on their emotions (i.e., the feelings triggered by the message viewing) [17, 18]."

To support the cognitive arguments in the video, Amini et al., suggest using simple and well-known data visualizations such as bar charts, pictographs, and maps to present the facts [4]. As for the emotional aspect of data videos, speciﬁcally those focused on moti- vating healthy behaviours, there are no clear empirical guidelines in the literature regarding the strategies or types of emotions that would be effective. Normally, campaigns that aim at promoting healthy behaviours would adopt one of two strategies; either a loss-framed or gain-framed strategy [19]."

Citing [22], Ojo and colleagues state that “stories are fundamental components of human experience [23]”. They further note how crucial the “mecha- nisms” of stories are for human communication because storytelling regularly has a strong format for inducing psychological effects. While data storytelling has captured much attention, narratives in the context of visual data storytelling are often different from regularstories (e.g., ﬁlms and books). While all the events are delivered in a “linear sequence” in ﬁlms and books, visual data stories regularly of- fer interactive functions to verify the users’ own discoveries, which could generate further inquires [24]. In this study, we aim to expand the arena of data storytelling by utilizing video as a medium (i.e., data video). Speciﬁcally, we aim to inﬂuence the viewers’ perception via data storytelling. Unlike other forms of data storytelling (e.g., interactive ﬁgures on a tablet or a smartphone), the narratives used in data videos can resemble to the ones used in ﬁlms and books (i.e., events are presented in linear sequences [24]). To fully beneﬁt from the nature of the video, which allows us to utilize common forms of storytelling, we focus on the roles of affect (or emotional experiences) in the data video context. 1Additionally, while consideration of positive affect is theoretically desir- able, negative emotions ﬁt in our videos more naturally as data we presented reﬂected the reality we were facing at the moment of writing (i.e., pandemic).3S TUDY The goal of this study was to explore the potential effect of narratives in inﬂuencing participants’ perception in data storytelling using a video format. Speciﬁcally, we explore the potential advantages of adding emotional components to data video (DV) in inﬂuencing its viewers’ perception. We applied psychological principles to induce emotional reactions2. Additionally, we explored how viewers’ comprehension level could be impacted when we add emotional experiences while they are processing cognitive information."

It combines the power of data visualizations and storytelling techniques and is popular in various media such as newspapers, interactive websites, and videos. Recently, virtual reality has brought new opportunities to enhance data storytelling with an incomparable sense of immersion. However, there exists a limited understanding of data stories in virtual reality (VR) as they are still in the early stage. In this paper, we investigated the idea of VR data videos by drawing inspiration from popular 3D data videos and studying how to transfer them from screens to VR. We systematically analyzed 100 highly-watched 3D data videos from Y outube and Tiktok channels to derive their design space. We then conducted a user study with 12 participants to explore the effects of four design factors on user experience, including varying cam- era angles, showing chart overview, animation, and using anchors."

They often incorporate creative, elegant, and professional visual designs to at- tract and engage viewers. Practitioners and researchers have studied different genres of data stories, such as interactive articles, info- graphics, and videos [57]. With the advance in media technologies, the media for data storytelling expands from screens to immersive environments [29], which are thought to bring the engagement and immersion of the audience to a new level. Yet, we have limited empirical knowledge about data storytelling in immersive environ- ments as it is still at an early stage. Recently, Lee et al.

A79,Understanding 3D Data Videos: From Screens to Virtual Reality,1,1,data storytelling,"However, our work focused on a different domain—data videos for data storytelling, in which design strategies are not only related to visualizations but also other storytelling techniques such as camera movement, the setting of scenes, and visual embellishment. 2.2 Narrative Visualization Narrative visualizations tell data-driven stories engagingly by com- bining data visualization and storytelling techniques. Initially, Segel and Heer [50] concluded seven genres of narrative visualizations, including magazine style, annotated chart, partitioned poster, ﬂow chart, comic strip, slide show, and ﬁlm/video/animation. Surround- ing these basic genres, follow-up work investigated design factors to enhance the understandability [2, 31, 53], memorability [7, 31], engagement [2], and emotional effects [34, 35], and provided design spaces to increase the expressiveness [36] of data stories. Previous work primarily focused on stories presented on computer screens. Recently, data-driven storytelling in VR started to draw attention from academia and industry [29, 38]. For example, Ren et al. [46] developed a prototype system XRCreator for authoring data story- telling in VR. More work adapted data stories to VR and conducteduser studies to derive design implications of data storytelling in VR. Bastiras et al. [5] recreated six stories in VR, which received morepositive feedback than their desktop versions in follow-up user stud- ies. Lee et al. [37] found that VR creates a visceral experience for people to understand the quantities and measurements such as dis- tance, speed, or height. Ivanov et al. [30] re-examined the effects of anthropomorphism and unit visualization techniques and found that they promoted affective responses and personal experiences."

The design factors we investigated come from a systematic analysis of a larger corpus of 100 3D data videos. 2.3 Data Video Data videos have been a focus of research in data storytelling. Many studies summarized animation techniques. Amini et al. [3] con- cluded eight animations and their realization in eight chart types.

A79,Understanding 3D Data Videos: From Screens to Virtual Reality,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"We started by searching keywords such as “3D data videos” and “data-driven storytelling”. However, this only generated a few videos from the search result pages, since video creators tended to name their videos by their semantics (e.g., “which animal has the longest neck” in Fig. 1). Nonetheless, the search results helped us identify several KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) in this ﬁeld. Their works were recommended on the ﬁrst few pages by search engines of Y outube and TikTok and they had at least 400K subscribers."

We conducted an interview study with experts in VR, ﬁlm, and datastorytelling. Speciﬁcally, we recruited 13 experts in VR (E1 - E5, with 1 to 4 years of experience), ﬁlm (E6 - E9, with 2 to 25 years of experience), and data storytelling (E11 - E13, with 2 to 6 years of experience). We ﬁrst introduced our design space to the experts and gave them full access to the video gallery on our website. Then, they rank the design strategies from an initial list of comparisons from four aspects: understandability, memorability, engagement,and emotional effect. As mentioned in Section 2.2, these metrics were commonly used for evaluating data stories in previous research. In the initial list, each comparison had at least two design strategies from one or a combination of dimensions in our design space. These strategies were popular in the corpus, or we found to bring different viewers’ experiences. When they found the effects of a strategydepended, they gave their explanations."

Moreover, not all participants appreciated the change of angles when they could not understand its narrative intention. For example, the ﬁrst-person point of view in the line chart was to create a feelingof going up and down with the trend of the stock market to showits uncertainty and risks. However, without narrations to indicate the message, a few participants could not fully understand the video."

Data storytelling is an emerging visualization paradigm that aims to “tell a story” with data in order to elicit deeper reflections in an effective manner. However, the effects of adding a narrative to a visualization on the memorability of the information remain speculative. Based on a review of related work, we synthesize a framework of data storytelling principles with con- crete actions for every principle. We use this framework to design an online, controlled experiment to test compare traditional data visualizations with data storytelling visualizations in terms of their effects on short-term and long-term recall of information displayed in the visualizations. In general, despite long-held assumptions in the visualization community, we find no significant differences in recall between traditional visualizations and data storytelling vi- sualization. However, we find indications that the cognitive load induced by different chart types and self-assessed prior knowledge on the chart topics could possibly have a moderating effect on information recall.

A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"Data storytelling (DS) is one such approach that allows us to compile data by telling a ‘story’ with numbers. The underlying assumption is that by conveying “data not just in numbers or charts, but as a narrative that humans can comprehend” [ 18], it is easier to tap into the emotional and decision-making areas of the brain, rather than just presenting facts and numbers like traditional data visualization techniques do [11]. However, researchers have only started to examine the effects and perceived benefits of data storytelling over traditional data visualization. While some work has shown indications of a positive effect of data storytelling visualizations on engagement [ 40], other work has shown no meaningful differences in terms of engage- ment [ 4,5] or empathy [ 21,25]. The picture on the influence of data storytelling principles on memorability of the information pre- sented in the visualization is similarly muddled. One study found no difference in short-term recall between data storytelling and traditional visualizations, but data storytelling visualizations with relevant visual embellishments did seem to fair better in terms of long-term recall [ 2]. Despite the lack of empirical evidence, it is often assumed that applying data storytelling principles increases memorability and engagement [ 21]. If we increasingly use data sto- rytelling visualizations in academic, business, and political contexts to communicate important information and provide an impact on the reader, one important criteria is that readers are also able to recall the key information in those visualizations. It is therefore important to more thoroughly investigate the effects that data sto- rytelling visualizations can have on readers’ recall of important information. In this paper, we take another step towards determining the influence of data storytelling principles on the memorability (or recall) of information presented in visualizations. Based on a review of related work, we synthesize a framework of data storytelling principles with concrete actions for every principle. We then use 67  this framework to design and conduct an online, controlled ex- periment to test compare traditional data visualizations with data storytelling visualizations in terms of their effects on short-term and long-term recall of information displayed in the visualizations. In our experiment, we focus on one of the most popular types: data visualizations annotated with narrative elements. Our setup enables us to answer the following research questions: RQ1 How do data storytelling visualizations relate to tradi- tional data visualizations and which principles characterize both techniques? RQ2 How does the application of data storytelling principles to data visualization influence short-term recall of information? RQ3 How does the application of data storytelling principles to data visualization influence long-term recall of information? In general, despite long-held assumptions in the visualization community, we find no significant differences in short- or long- term recall between traditional visualizations and data storytelling visualization. However, we find indications that the cognitive load induced by different chart types and self-assessed prior knowledge on the chart topics could possibly have a moderating effect on information recall. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We review the related work on data visualization, data storytelling and their per- ceived effects on the next section. In Section 3, we present a frame- work of principles for producing data storytelling visualizations along with concrete actions, and contrast it with traditional data visualization principles. Sections 4 and 5 describe respectively the methodology and results of our online, controlled experiment. We discuss our findings and conclude in Section 6. 2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Data visualization According to Tufte [36],visualization is a means to visually present measured quantities with specific visual elements e.g. lines, shapes, colors, words, symbols and similar. Traditional visualizations in- clude (but are not limited to) line charts, pie charts, bar charts, area charts, bubble charts, scatter plots, tree maps, heat maps."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"Later, this work was replicated and confirmed by Heer and Bostock [15] on a larger scale using crowdsourcing. 2.2 Data storytelling Data storytelling is a more recent visualization paradigm that aims to combine a narrative with data in order to “tell a story” and elicit deeper reflections on the data the visualization represents [ 8,19]. As argued by Chatman [7]and Zhang [38], narratives consist of two parts: (1) the story, which is shown in the narrative; and (2) the discourse, or how a narrative is shown. The story is further subdi- vided into two topics: events (actions, happenings) and existents. In simpler terms, the story is the what in a narrative that is depicted, the discourse is how."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"Ryan [32], another proponent of data storytelling, described to this approach asinformation compression : smashing complicated information into manageable pieces by focusing on what is most important and then pretending it is whole and bound entirely within the visualization(s) used to illustrate the message. According to a study by Nowak et al . [26] , using narrative tech- niques to tell the data story also appears to pay off. In their study, they asked participants to describe both visualizations with data storytelling elements and more traditional visualizations. The de- scriptions of the data storytelling visualizations tended to resemble the intended narrative, while the descriptions of traditional vi- sualization focused more on decoding and usability flaws in the visualizations, suggesting that narrative techniques work and are helpful in getting the message across. Segel and Heer [33] argued that most visualization tools aim to produce visualizations for exploration and analysis only, thereby leaving it to the reader to find the story behind the graphic. They analyzed a large number of visualizations in the context of online journalism and defined three distinct features of this visual design space features: genre, visual narrative tactics and narrative structure tactics. In addition, based on their analysis they also proposed three common types of storytelling approaches: the martini glass struc- ture, the interactive slideshow and the drill-down story."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"Data storytelling principles have been applied successfully in different domains. For instance, Thöny et al . [35] describe how the application of data storytelling principles to geographic visualiza- tion systems can help to better guide the audience and expand the accessibility of the information in these systems to a more general audience [ 22,39]. In the field of journalism, data storytelling prin- ciples have also been applied successfully [ 27] as well as analyzed systemically in order to determine what makes an award-winning data story [24]. 2.3 Effects of data storytelling Only in recent years have researchers started to examine the effects of data storytelling over traditional data visualization on different constructs, such as engagement, empathy, and recall. Engagement. Boy et al . [5] evaluated the impact of using narra- tive visualization techniques and storytelling on engagement with exploratory information visualizations. They conducted three web- based field experiments on a popular news outlet and on a popular visualization gallery website."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Zhao et al . [40] investigated the effectiveness of the comic strip narrative style for data-driven storytelling. They focused in particular on the partition- ing (i.e., chunking complex visuals into manageable pieces) and the sequence of visualizations (i.e., organizing them into a meaningful order). Through a qualitative study, they found that the data comic format did increase engagement with and perceived usability of the visualizations. Empathy."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data story,"Liem et al . [21] examined the influence of data story- telling visualizations on another construct: empathy (or prosociality) in an immigration context. They compared three different visual- izations: (1) personal visual narratives designed to evoke empathy; (2) structured visual narratives about groups of people; and (3) a traditional data visualization without narrative elements. They com- pared these three conditions in two crowdsourcing studies on the participants’ attitudes towards immigration, but found no evidence that the two data storytelling conditions elicited more positive atti- tudes towards immigration than the traditional data visualization. Their work confirmed the findings Boy et al . [6], who compared anthropomorphized embellishments to standard embellishment for narrative visualizations and found a similar lack of influence on empathy. These findings were confirmed by Morais et al . [25] , who tested an information-rich anthropomorphized data storytelling visualization against a simple bar chart in a crowdsourcing study and asked participants to donate hypothetical money. They found a similarly small effect on empathy. Recall. In the visualization community, data storytelling is of- ten assumed to increase memorability and, as a result, recall of information [ 21]. Storytelling in general has been shown to have an impact on information recall. Bower and Clark [3]tested the recall of words embedded in stories versus recall from a random list of words and found that participants who constructed storiesremembered six to seven times more words than participants in the list condition. In a related experiment, Heath and Heath [14, pp. 42-44 ]asked students to give short presentations on crime sta- tistics and asked them afterwards to write down everything they could remember from the speeches."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"In contrast to the work by Bateman et al . [2]—which did not focus on data storytelling—we specifically focus on data storytelling visualizations and compare them to traditional data visualizations in order to determine the effect of the presence of a narrative on recall. 3 A FRAMEWORK OF DATA STORYTELLING PRINCIPLES In order to reliably examine the effects of data storytelling visu- alizations on recall as compared to traditional data visualizations, we need a reproducible approach for generating data storytelling visualizations. A handful of researchers have come up with different guides—suited to different domains and usage contexts—on how to generate high-quality data visualizations, and how to effectively add a narrative to these visualizations. Our starting point in producing a framework for producing data storytelling visualizations was the work by Knaflic [19], Ryan [31], Segel and Heer [33], Hullman and Diakopoulos [17], Bach et al . [1], and Echeverria et al . [12] , from which we collected a variety of of visualization and storytelling principles. After merging similar principles, we devised a combined model of the principles behind both traditional data visualizations and data storytelling visualizations, which is shown in Figure 1a. It shows that while the initial stages of the two approaches are simi- lar, they start diverging at the principle Eliminate the clutter . At this step, eliminating clutter for data storytelling visualizations explic- itly means removing all unnecessary, non-data related information 69 –Brainstorm & research –Find data Concrete actionsPhasesExplore the data Cra! the visualizationTell the story–Clean data –Manipulate data if applicable PrinciplesUnderstand the context Deﬁne the audience and the purpose of the visualisationAggregate & summarize data Deﬁne the main data points to deliver the purpose Apply a visual Translate data into a visualisation Eliminate clutter Reduce the cognitive loadDirect attention Ensure visual guidance for the user Facilitate the narrative Deliver the message –Select an appropriate graph type–Apply Gestalt principles –Remove data labels, data markers, grid, legend, tick marks, axis label–Remove unnecessary data and push necessary, but non-focal data to the background –Choose prea""entive a""ributes for focal data points e.g. orientation, shape, size, line length, hue, intensity, curvature–Apply narrative text labels to focal data points –Ordering & Interactivity –Clear title delivering the main insight or outcome Aggregate & summarize dataUnderstand the contextApply a visualEliminate clu!erApply aesthesticsTraditional data visualization Facilitate the narrativeData storytellingUnderstand the contextAggregate & summarize dataApply a visualEliminate clu!erDirect a!ention (a) Principles of DV and DS(b) Data storytelling frameworkFigure 1: Figure 1a (left) shows the where the principles behind creating traditional data visualizations vs. data storytelling visualizations are the same and where they diverge. Figure 1b (right) shows our framework for creating data storytelling visualizations as synthesized from the literature. completely—tick marks, labels, grids and other to minimize the cog- nitive load to the minimum. However, for traditional visualizations, such ‘drastic’ measures need not always be applied. If there is no message or outcome explicitly stated, traditional visualizations still require ‘background’ information such as axis labels, the legend, and a grid with corresponding values for the user to be able to explore each data value. Nevertheless, for traditional data visual- izations these also tend to be edited to minimize the cognitive load, such as by choosing a simple background grid, or by adjusting the breaks for numeric values on the axes."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data story,"After their divergence, the next stage in creating a data story- telling visualization is to direct attention to specific data points or trends rather than explicitly displaying the whole dataset. In contrast, the last stage of traditional data visualization is to apply aesthetics , which includes choosing appropriate colors, readable fonts, or general stylistic themes. This stylization is also a part of data storytelling visualization, but more for the purpose of drawing attention to certain data points by, for instance, intensifying the color of important points while attenuating non-focal (yet neces- sary) data points. Finally, in data storytelling visualizations we need to facilitate the narrative by adding narrative elements. This is a core princi- ple of data storytelling: creating a story by explaining the trends with insights or by highlighting clear outcomes in titles or other annotations. This guided explanation of the data is in contrast to traditional visualizations, which requires readers to explore the visualization on their own and draw their own conclusions. To facilitate the reproducible generation of data storytelling visualizations, we expanded on each principle in Figure 1a by listingconcrete actions to be taken in that stage. The complete framework for generating data storytelling visualizations is shown in Figure 1b. We furthermore grouped the principles together into three main phases, resulting in a framework with three levels: (1)Phases reflect the thematic focus of the principles they com- prise and are three-fold: Explore the data ,Craft the visualiza- tionandTell the story . (2)Principles represent the individual steps needed to reach the final visualization, which include (1) Understand the con- text, (2)Aggregate & summarize the data , (3)Apply a visual , (4)Eliminate clutter , (5)Direct the attention , and (6) Facilitate the narrative . (3)Concrete actions further elaborate on the principles. These actions should be understood as measures to take only if applicable. Whether an action is required, depends on the data, domain, context, and the desired outcome."

Each correctly answered forced-choice question was awarded with one point. With three tasks and four questions per task, this meant that participants could score between 0 and 12 points on their short-term recall test. Recall performance of our participants was relatively high for both conditions."

As a result, we used the Mann- Whitney Utest to test for significant differences between the two conditions. Short-term recall scores summed over all three tasks combined were higher in the DS condition ( mean rank = 49.97) than in the DV condition ( mean rank = 44.69). However, a Mann-Whitney Utest revealed that this difference was not statistically significant (U(NDV=44,NDS=50) = 1223.5, z=0.96,p=.34)."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data story,"The dif- ference between short-term and long-term recall is indeed smaller for the DS condition ( MDS=1.66,SD=1.66) than for the DV condition ( MDV=1.95,SD=1.74), which suggests that data story telling visualizations could mitigate the effects of memory attenua- tion better than traditional visualizations. However, this difference was not statistically significant according to a Mann-Whitney U testU(NDV=44,NDS=50) = 1012.5, z=0.67, p = 0.50). 5.4 Influence of prior knowledge Even though we filtered out participants that were too knowl- edgable about at least one of the three topics according to their 74 self-assessment in the pre-experiment questionnaire, prior knowl- edge may still influence recall performance. Prior knowledge about a topic, even a little, could be reinforced upon seeing a visualization, which could make it easier to recall information from the visual- ization. To examine the possible influence of prior knowledge, we correlated their self-assessed knowledge about a task topic and the short-term recall scores they achieved."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"However, in the data storytelling condition, there was no significant correlation between prior knowledge and short-term recall performance ( ρ(50)=−0.13,p=.34). The discrepancy be- tween prior knowledge and short-term recall scores may be due to incorrect preconceptions about costs being harder to dislodge, perhaps because people had different cities in mind when assessing their prior knowledge. Perhaps the presence of narrative elements in the DS condition is enough to do away with these misconcep- tions, where the baseline DV visualization is not able to succeed in this. 6 DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we presented the results of an online, controlled experiment designed to compare traditional data visualizations with data storytelling visualizations in terms of their effects on short-term and long-term recall of information displayed in the visualizations. We did not find any significant differences in either short-term or long-term recall between our two experimental conditions, even though in general average recall scores were higher after being exposed to data storytelling visualizations, both immediately after completing the tasks and after a delay period of one week. This means we cannot confirm assumptions held by parts of the data visualization community that data storytelling has a positive effect on recall of information [21]. When drilling down into the three different visualization tasks, we do find indications that chart type has a moderating influence on the effects of including narrative elements on top of a baseline visualization. For our Costs of a night out task, where the baseline visualization was a bar chart, recall performance was significantly higher in the data storytelling condition. In the case of Men’s voices in pop music , where the baseline visualization was combination of a line chart and a scatterplot, the DS condition also saw higher recall scores, but not significantly so. However, for the Unsolved US homicides —a map visualization combined with proportional circular areas—adding narrative elements appeared to decrease recall performance, albeit not significantly so. Earlier work by Heer and Bostock [15] and Cleveland and McGill [9]has shown that chart types differ in the cognitive load they invoke when reading and decoding them, and we believe this is a plausible explanationfor our results."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"The drop-off in performance was steeper for the traditional data visualizations than for the data storytelling condition, which could suggest that narrative embellishments could help mitigate memory attenuation better than only the baseline visualizations. However, this difference was not significant; perhaps a longer delay period would have shown an even stronger effect. In their work, Bateman et al . [2]used a delay period of 2-3 weeks and they did find a significant difference in long-term recall (but not in short-term recall). However, they focused only on visual embellishments and had a different experimental setup, so their results are not directly comparable."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"However, more focused work is needed to be able to draw any strong conclusions about this potential relationship. 6.1 Future work There are many fruitful avenues of future work that follow from our experimental findings, foremost being the possible relationship between chart type complexity and data storytelling. We found sufficient indications that chart types that required more cognitive effort to decode did not benefit from adding narrative elements to them. However, we only compared three different chart types, so our results are far from conclusive. Future work should look into using the work by Heer and Bostock [15] to select more and more different chart categories by cognitive load and then examine the benefits of data storytelling for each of them. It would also be interesting to examine whether a chart’s cognitive load has 75 an impact on engagement, empathy or other attributes. Explicitly measuring cognitive load and modeling it as a dependent variable would also be a useful next step. Future studies should also consider the influence of motivation for participating in studies like ours, as also argued by Knaflic [19]."
A81,The Influence of Data Storytelling on the Ability to Recall Information,1,1,data storytelling,"When producing our data visualizations, we were guided by our framework of data storytelling principles synthesized from related work. However, we limited our data storytelling style to the so- called ‘Martini Glass’ structure [ 33]. Other narrative storytelling styles could potentially lead to different results. 6.2 Conclusions While more work needs to be done, through our framework of data storytelling principles and the findings from our online, controlled experiments, we have taken a solid next step towards examining the influence of data storytelling visualizations on the recall of information highlighted in those visualizations.

A86,A Guided Tour of Literature Review: Facilitating Academic Paper Reading with Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative visualization [29], an emerging type of visualization, has the potential to meet this need. Narrative visualization turns sophisticated data into a ﬂow of visual forms, the style of which can vary based on the characteristics of data to make the entire representation more understandable and engaging. In this paper, we propose the use of interactive slides, a common type of nar- rative visualization, to facilitate reading scientiﬁc papers. As the ﬁrst attempt to develop a narrative visualization application, we start with visualizing the literature review section, a.k.a. “Related Work” or “Background”, of a research paper. It is because this part is content-intensive, and thus additional navigation and searching are needed. Also, the related work section is often relatively well- structured so that we do not need to employ complex natural lan- guage processing techniques. We develop a system that processes a given research paper and converts its survey of related work into a series of interactive slides."
A86,A Guided Tour of Literature Review: Facilitating Academic Paper Reading with Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"The major contributions of this paper are as follows: We design and implement a narrative visualization system. The system presents literature review in interactive slides and integrates additional data regarding each citation to enable users explore our system in a ﬂexible manner. We investigate the characteristics of our target users and de- sign a multi-level structure to support different reading styles. Two types of narrative logic ﬂows are designed to cater for users’ needs under various usage scenarios. We conduct controlled experiments to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different narrative logics, and study users’ behaviors and preferences when reading with and without the support of our system. 2. RELATED WORK The literature review is usually in the “Related Work” section of academic papers [17, 18]."
A86,A Guided Tour of Literature Review: Facilitating Academic Paper Reading with Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative Visualization. Narrative visualization consists of a ﬂow of visual forms with internal logic [29]. Segel and Heer pre- sented the ﬁrst systematic study of the design space of narrative visualization [29]. In addition, Amini et al. systematically study data videos to understand what elements are featured in narrative visualization [3]. As narrative visualization is traditionally crafted by designers and often appears in journalism [29], researchers tried to derive design guidelines for narrative visualization, investigating how visual techniques [13] and the order of presentation [14] may inﬂuence viewers’ comprehension. However, these studies only aimed at composing a sequence of simple imageries such as charts. Their ﬁndings may not apply to more complex text data. In our system, we incorporate not only visual narrative tactics, such as visual structuring and transition guidance, but also narra- tive structure tactics such as ordering and interactivity [29], to pro- vide an integrated reading experience."
A86,A Guided Tour of Literature Review: Facilitating Academic Paper Reading with Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION In this section, we analyze the opportunities and challenges of building a narrative visualization system for literature review. We surveyed a set of tutorials on writing scientiﬁc papers, to gain in- sights from the authors’ perspective [8]. Furthermore, we observed and interviewed eight researchers (ages ranged from 23 to 32; 2 females) from three research areas in computer science about how they read academic papers. As representatives of our target users, six of these researchers were relatively senior with over four years of research experience, while the rest were second-year postgradu- ate students."

The whole system should be legible and intuitive, as our target users may not have much experience with data visualization.

A86,A Guided Tour of Literature Review: Facilitating Academic Paper Reading with Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION SYSTEM To offer researchers a better reading experience, we design a three-level interactive slideshow system with precompiled logic ﬂows (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst level is an overview slide; the second level con- sists of a linear sequence of slides; and the third level presents each citation, together with its augmented information. Fig. 4 shows the relationships among these three levels and illustrates three viewing styles enabled by the three-level system. We carefully design two logic ﬂows to tell the story of related work from different perspectives, namely, author-based logic ﬂow (ABLF) that preserves the original plot of a given paper and citation- oriented logic ﬂow (COLF) that focuses on the evidences and their relations."

The new relationship is called data-driven journalism. The emerging product of this relationship: data-based  visualization that reveals the story behind the data.

A88,How to Tell Stories Using Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Keywords —Storytelling, narrative visualization. 1 Introduction Since the beginning of time man has used stories to entertain, educate, and instill moral values. Stories, in com- parison to other ways of presenting information, prevail not only due to their power to help the assimilation and retention of information, but also because stories are in fact more compelling. Predating writing, storytelling is still more frequently associated with oral lore even though it is present in our everyday life in written form, video, and audio. However storytelling has come a long way from its traditional roots and is now a useful tool for education, information, entertainment, and other areas."
A88,How to Tell Stories Using Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"However it is known that storytelling has the power to engage and make people relate, and possibly facilitating the sharing of tacit knowledge. 2.1 Narrative visualization Information visualization is much more than the visual representation of data. It is rather the process of dissecting raw data, which by itself has little meaning and presenting it in a way that it is no longer complex. Although, visualiza- tion is not a new area, it has blossomed with the emergence of new media. “These new technologies truly allow us to do things we never could with paper, so we should expect it to take awhile to gain sufﬁcient understanding of them before we can apply them as effectively as we would like” [8]. Moved by the rise of these new media Gershon and Page were the ﬁrst to notice the valuable contribution that story- telling could give to Information visualization."
A88,How to Tell Stories Using Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"All of these elements make narrative visualization pleas- ing, not only because it doesn’t require a lot of time and effort to assimilate the information but also because it sparks the audience’s curiosity and transforms the task of acquir- ing information into a fun activity. According to Ma et al. [14], “they leave a lasting impression, either by piquing the audience’s curiosity and making them want to learn more or by conveying a deeper meaning than your everyday run-of-the-mill sequence of causally related events.” However there has been an increasing concern with how much the incorporation of narrative will impact the explo- ration of the data and whether or not this will distract the user from the data [ 4]. Although having a direction will help users that are less familiar with the subject an undirected exploration can help proﬁcient users ﬁnd new interpreta- tions of the data and even discover meanings that were not foreseen by the creators of the visualization. It’s important to understand every building block of the visualization in order to create a narrative that doesn’t overpower the data."
A88,How to Tell Stories Using Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,In this case the narrative visualizations created were meant to accompany online news. It would be interesting to see how the participants would react to more game like visualizations. After all computer games are the most popular example of interactive story- telling [ 13] and maybe their form of storytelling can be successfully replicated in visualizations. SPENT12is one of the few attempts of merging visual- ization and games.
A88,How to Tell Stories Using Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"In fact, according to Kosara and Mackinlay [ 13] “one of the fundamental features of stories is that they provide a temporal structure, even if not necessarily linear.” Therefore if visualizations are able to not only introduce storytelling elements but also have a story ﬂow they will be more suc- cessful and then can be considered narrative visualizations. Conclusion In the same way that a well-told story is able to convey a large amount of information in a simpler and more com- pelling way (enabling the audience to assimilate and retain the information transmitted [ 8]) a well structured visualiza- tion can also captivate the audience. Technology provided us with new tools to convey information in a story-like fashion[8] and that is clearly transforming our preferences. People get excited with good visualizations and the proof of this fact is that people are sharing these visualizations on- line, often not even caring if they have an article associated with it."

More- over the interest in the area has also sparked outside of the research community due to its prospect of use in areas such as journalism, marketing, or education. The challenge is not only discovering ways to highlight the potential stories that exist within the data but also to transform visualizations in such a way that they adopt several narrative characteristics and eventually become a form of storytelling itself. If visualizations get successfully infused with narrative we can overcome both the limitations of textual and vi- sual representation."

The authors state that these data stories are an emerging class of visualizations. In addition to providing a typology for classifying visualizations and generalized advice for de- signing narrative visualizations, the authors also identiﬁed patterns and structures that news media use to introduce storytelling: Martini Glass Structure, Interactive Slideshow, and Drill-Down Story. These structures vary in terms of how much author-driven paths and how it is structured: the ﬁrst beginning with an author-driven approach that opens up to a reader-driven stage once the author’s narrative is over, the second being a completely linear path with some interactivity within the limits of each slide, and the last one being completely reader-driven. Segel and Heer also argue that most visualizations do not ﬁt the author-driven (Ex- planatory) versus reader-driven (Exploratory) dichotomy, so commonly established among visualization creators, and are somewhere in the middle. Even narrative dense visu- alizations can include data that can be freely explored by users and let them draw their own insights."
A89,Narrative Visualization: A Case Study of How to Incorporate Narrative Elements in Existing Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"Good narrative visualizations allow the user to engage with the data, makes the insight jump out, and helps users to cope with their short attention spans and lack of data literacy. Nowadays most visualizations depend on dif- ferent media to provide explanations about the data, usually text. However, often people try to interpret the visualiza- tion by it self and do not care about the extra information necessary for its interpretation. Visualizations that are too exploratory with little author-driven guidance can under- mine comprehensibility and engagement, resulting in a user that is under-informed or even misinformed."
A89,Narrative Visualization: A Case Study of How to Incorporate Narrative Elements in Existing Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"Segel and Heer’s approach aimed towards structure and generalized advice for design- ing narrative visualizations. Hullman and Diakopoulos go farther proposing an analytical framework for visualization rhetoric that cross editorial layers (data, visual represen- tation, textual annotation, and interactivity) and a set of techniques for visualization rhetoric(omission, metonymy, data provenance, representing uncertainty, identiﬁcation, obscuring, contrast, classiﬁcation, redundancy, typographic emphases, irony, similarity, individualization, anchoring, ﬁltering). Their objective went towards the constitution of a guide to how much visualization rhetoric should be used on the design of visualizations. They also give insights about the impact of these rhetorical aspects inﬂuence the user’s interpretation of the original data."
A89,Narrative Visualization: A Case Study of How to Incorporate Narrative Elements in Existing Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"We were driven by the motivation to pave the way to future research on the im- pact of these strategies and on the establishment of design conventions for narrative visualization. One of our main goals was to research techniques that add a story feel to the visualizations without however pre- venting the free exploration of the data. Narrative visual- ization shouldn’t become a lean-back format, accordingly the quest to add storytelling has to be weighted so that it does not lead to a linear, too author-driven interpretation path for the user. Stories in visualization should be used as starting points for data exploration or short moments of insight about the data, rather than a predigested narrative."
A89,Narrative Visualization: A Case Study of How to Incorporate Narrative Elements in Existing Visualizations,1,1,narrative visualization,"To make further progress on narrative visualization we still need to know: what makes it work; which of the narrative visualizations that are being produced in news media, advertising, research, edu- cation, etc. are having the desired effect on users; how and where should narrative elements be placed; how should the story be structured; what is the impact of these stories on the users. We’re at an inﬂection point where we understand the design dimensions enough to start working towards the con- struction of models for narrative visualizations. Once these are built they should be employed in the design of visu- alizations, tested, and maybe then we will achieve some answers to these questions.

Results indicate that the  adaptation s succeed in guiding attention to salient components of  the narrative visualizations , especially by generating more  transitions between key components of the visualization  (i.e.,  datapoints, labels and legend) . We als o show that the adaptation   helps users with lower levels of visualization literacy to better  map datapoints to the legend, which leads in part to improved  comprehension of the visualization .

This has generated increasing research on  how to provide  personalized support to visualization processing, ranging from  recomm ending  alternative visualizations based on recorded user’s  preferences [11, 23] to adapting the amount of in formation  included in a visualization [42], and guiding  users’ attention  within the visualization."
A91,Understanding the Effectiveness of Adaptive Guidance for Narrative Visualization: A Gaze-Based Analysis,1,1,narrative visualization,"Steinberger et al. [34] investigated how to guide user attention  in narrative visualizations by displaying up front a set of lines  linking words in the text to the corresponding information in the visualization, leading to reduced visual search time. However,  providing all the links upfront does not scale to visualizations that  contain a large amount of links between the text and the  visualization, as it may overly clutter the visualization. Zhi et al.  [41] proposed an alternative approach that avoids cluttering by  allowing the user s to willingly trigger the guid ance mechanism,  when they like. Parts of the text that refer to datapoints in the  visualization are underlined, and the user can click on each of these parts to have the relevant elements of an accompanying  visualization highlighted."

In recent work   [20] we attempted to overcome these issues by proposing  a novel  gaze- driven adaptive mechanism that dynamically highlights the  relevant parts of the visualization when users read the corresponding part in the text , as captured via  eye-tracking  (see  Figure 2). We found that such adaptive guidance leads to  improved comprehension of the narrative visualizations, but only for users with low levels of visualization literacy ( vis literacy  from now on: the ability to use common data visualizations in an efficient and confident manner  [4]). Eye-tracking is also commonly used to evaluate how users  process information visualizations, e.g., [5, 19, 28, 38, 39] , as  it  can reveal the underlying attentional behaviors  of use rs. In  particular , previous work has showed that eye- tracking can reveal  how vis literacy influences  gaze behaviors during processing of  non-adaptive visualizations,  showing for instance that low vis  literacy users focus less on important regions of the visualizations   compared to high literac y users  [19, 24]. Eye-tracking has also  been used to drive adaptation in real time based on user s’ gaze  behaviors in maps, but without successfully improving user  performance [9]."
A91,Understanding the Effectiveness of Adaptive Guidance for Narrative Visualization: A Gaze-Based Analysis,1,1,narrative visualization,"In this paper, we leverage eye- tracking to evaluate how the  gaze- driven adaptive guidance  we presented in  Lallé et al.  [20]  support s processing of narrative visualizations , depending on the  user’s levels of vis literacy . Specifically, we address the following  research questions :  • RQ1: How does adaptive guidance in narrative visualizations  influence users’ gaze behaviors, compared to no guidance?  • RQ2:  What are the changes in gaze behaviors of users with  low vis literacy that can explain their better comprehension when provided with adaptati ve guidance? In exploring these research question s, we present two main  contributions. First,  we uncover the underlying eye movement changes that are induced by the target adaptive guidance. As  discussed, while  previous  work provided such guidance in  narrative visualizations [20, 34, 41] , it is still unknown how  exactly users benefit from them, and how they process them . We  fill this gap by sh owing that these adaptations lead to increased  integration of the key elements  of the visualization (labels, legend,  datapoints), as shown by an increased amount of transitions between them . Furthermore, the adaptations lead to  more  processing of the relev ant datapoints  and of the legend of the  visualization . Second, we reveal how this adaptive mechanism affects users  differently depending on their levels of vis literacy ."
A91,Understanding the Effectiveness of Adaptive Guidance for Narrative Visualization: A Gaze-Based Analysis,1,1,narrative visualization,"There has been a recent interest in studying cuing for  supporting the processing of visualizations embedded in narrative text, often called magazine -style narrative visualizations , or  MSNV  for short  [32]. MSNV is a widespread form of visualization  frequently used to convey story out of data in the press, textbooks,  scientific documents, etc. Cuing in MSNVs  is meant to guide the  user attention to relevant  datapoints  in the visu alization, i.e.,  datapoints that are described (or referred to ) in the narrative text. One approach for delivering these cues is by displaying them upfront in the MSNV, as done in Steinberger et al.

While they found that  users extensively use such on -demand cues, it did not result in  improved reading comprehension, possibly because users did not  use the on -demand cues in an effective manner, or because not all  users can effectively process them."
A91,Understanding the Effectiveness of Adaptive Guidance for Narrative Visualization: A Gaze-Based Analysis,1,1,narrative visualization,"We also extend the type of visualizations studied in  [9, 33] by focusing on narrative visualizations, and further  examine how  vis literacy  affects processing of the gaze- driven  guidance.  2.3 Eye- Tracking and Individual Differences   There is extensive evidence that user performance in non -adaptive  visualiz ation tasks is impacted by individual differences, such as  cognitive abilities, personality traits and expertise (see [6, 26] for  an overview). To understand the se differences in performance,  researchers have leveraged eye -tracking to investigate if and how  individual differences influence processing of stand -alone  visualizations. Most of this research has focused on comparing  eye-tracking patterns of experts and novices in different  visualization  tasks, namely map reading [25], visual information  search [17] and processing of scientific charts [12, 35] . A few  studies have investigated how cognitive abilities and skills influence gaze patterns  in low -level analytic tasks with bar and  radar charts [37, 39] , in decision makin g tasks with maps and  deviation charts [19], and in tasks involving to understand medical  information with bar chart s and line charts [24]."

We then discuss the  implications that the presented eye -gaze analysis holds for  evaluating adapt ive visualizations (Section 6.2).   6.1  Implications for Personalization   Our results show that providing adaptive guidance encourages  several gaze behaviors, which can be leveraged to refine the  adaptation mechanism via personalization to the user’s levels  of  vis literacy. Users with l ow vis literacy: These  are the users who were  found to significantly improve their comprehension of the  MSNVs when receiving adaptive guidance, and our analysis  identified gaze behaviors that can explain their improved  perform ance. We found that, when provided with adaptive  guidance,  these users fixated more on the relevant bars,  transitioned more between the relevant regions of the bar chart,  and were more engaged in processing the legend (Section 5.1)."
A91,Understanding the Effectiveness of Adaptive Guidance for Narrative Visualization: A Gaze-Based Analysis,1,1,narrative visualization,"Altogether, our findings show that the effectiveness of  adaptive guidance in narrative visualization s could be improved  via personalization to the user’ levels of vis literacy. In order to  deliver such personalized guidance, one possible approach is to automatically infer the user’s levels of vis literacy from their  gaze  behaviors, as done in [7]. This would be especially suitable for  narrative visualizations as our r esults indicate that users exhibit  specific gaze behaviors that might accurately reveal their levels of vis literacy.   6.2 Eye- tracking for Evaluating Adaptive  Visualizations  Our work shows that eye -tracking can be valuable to understand  how and why adaptive guidance may benefit specific groups of  users in narrative visualizations. While previous work has mostly leveraged  attention maps and  fixation time over the adaptive  component to perform such evaluation  [9, 33], here we show that  capturing gaze transitions among different regions of the  visualization is important as well to uncover the user’s processing  strategy. In particular , we found that highlighting one specific part  of the MSNV , seems to generate proactive processing of other  important related components in the  visualization . Thus,  one  should leverage processing metrics (transitions across AOIs) in  addition t o attention metrics (fixation within AOIs)  to evaluate in  depth the effectiveness of adaptive visualizations."
A91,Understanding the Effectiveness of Adaptive Guidance for Narrative Visualization: A Gaze-Based Analysis,1,1,narrative visualization,"Such analysis could reveal other  strategies that could further inform the design of improved  adaptive guidance for narrative visualizations.  7 Conclusion   In this paper we leveraged eye -tracking to evaluate  the  effectiveness of  gaze- driven adaptive guidance in MSNVs, a  widespread form of narrative visualiz ations in real -world sources. The evaluated guidance consists in dynamically highlighting the  relevant datapoints (bars in a bar -chart) when a user reads a  reference sentence that describes them, as captured by an eye - tracker. Previous work has shown that such adaptive guidance can  improve comprehension of the MSNV, however, only for users  with low vis literacy. We extend this previous work by revealing  the specific gaze behaviors that the adaptive guidance generates in  users, depending on their levels of v is literacy."

Analyzing the  elements used by news medi a to tell visual data stories Segel  and Heer identified some pa tterns and introduced three  structures or narrative strategies: Martini Glass Structure,  Interactive Slideshow, and Dr ill-Down Story. The first  structure starts with an author-driven approach with the  default view of the visualization and only once the author’s  intended narrative is complete, the visualization opens up to  a reader-driven stage where the user is free to explore the  data interactively. In the Interactive Slideshow the  visualization is presented as a typ ical slideshow with some  interactivity in each slide. Drill-Down Story is based on a  strict reader-driven approach, where the us er can choose any  order possible to in teract with the story."

Broad guidelines to help create the best narrative strategies for different types of visualizations are still lacking.

A94,Once Upon a Time in a Land Far Away: Guidelines for Spatio-Temporal Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative Visualization The emerging genre of Narrative Visualization, a term coined by Segel and Heer [20] in 2010, concerns visualizations that intend to communicate complex data effectively, in a way that is engaging and promotes the sharing of insights. It emerged as a way to turn visualizations into an independent form of storytelling, not as extra information or supporting evidence, as it has been seen until very recently [20]. The goal is that the visualization can exist by itself, without the backing of other supportive means of storytelling, and that it does not need to depend so much on the audience’s ability to interpret the data correctly in order to get the point across in sufﬁcient detail. According to Dove and Jones [3] “one of the distinguishing features of narrative visualization is the use of interactive exploratory techniques to enhance the communication of ideas and promote insight through discovery.”C. The importance of insights Providing insights on the data is the primary purpose of information visualization [1, 6, 22] and an aspect that should not be neglected. Insights can be seen as an accurate or deep understanding of something, and according to North [23] is a process that becomes more complex in visualization because of the amount of data, sometimes requiring the exploration of the complete dataset. The insights should be ﬁrstly identiﬁed in the data modeling step of the process when the conceptual model of how data items relate to each other is established."

Analytical narrations of games that seek to compose a complete game from heterogeneous datasets are challenging for general media producers because such a composition is time-consuming and heavily depends on domain experts. In particular, an appropriate analytical commentary of basketball games requires two factors, namely, rich context and domain knowledge, which includes game events, player locations, player proﬁles, and team proﬁles, among others. This type of analytical commentary elicits a timely and effective basketball game data visualization made up of different sources of media."

We investigate how the learning design of a course can be leveraged to build interfaces that help students reconstruct stories about their behavior, that make sense in the context of the academic’s learning intentions at a time. DS is a process of translating data analysis outputs into terms that can be understood by people without formal data science train- ing, to inﬂuence a subsequent decision or action [11]. The imple- mentation of DS in LA aims to guide students’ reﬂection on evidence by reducing the complexity of data representations in order to reduce the chances of erroneous interpretation [12]."

This involves removing headers, borders, grids, and data points that are not central to the story.4)DS4: A data story should guide attention. Only data points that are critical to communicate a story should be emphasized using visual or narrative elements. This can be achieved by the following: 1)adding enhancements such as arrows, lines, sym- bols, or enclosures; 2) changing color ,contrast ,o rthickness ; 3)annotating salient data features and adding head- line titles that summarize the message of the story.

A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"Multimodal Data Modeling The ﬁrst step in crafting data stories was to convert the data into a meaningful multimodal data structure.

C. Crafting the Data Stories The last modeling step is the visual representation of the data story. Based on the rules described above, two storytell- ing prototypes were created. Following principle DS2 (selec- tion of an appropriate chart type), both prototypes were based on a minimalistic visualization technique ( DS3: strip out excess detail), namely, a timeline of actions by each nurse within a team during the simulation (captured by the manikin and the observer, presented as annotated blue circles on each nurse’s line of actions; see Fig. 3).

A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"Students made an average of 3.6 errors (Study 1, out of ﬁve actions) and 2.3 errors (Study 2, out of six actions), before inspecting the data stories, reduced to 2.6 and 1.8 errors respectively, after the reﬂection activity. This suggests that the reﬂection activity helped them to identify the errors they had not correctly identiﬁed. It is possible, however, that any activity that engaged them in reconstructing a week- old simulation might have helped refresh their understanding, so deeper insights are needed to claim that the data stories were adding speciﬁc value. During the think-aloud protocol, students explained in detail their perspectives on how the data stories offered guid- ance for them to interpret the timeline. Students in all nine teams appreciated the guidance o f f e r e db ye a c hd a t as t o r yt ob ea b l et o focus on the expected learning goals. For example, a student explained: “ [the data stories] divide the screen into sections [critical incidents of patient]. These sections look ed like the same thing in [the timeline of actions without enh ancements]."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"Other students more explicitly explained the value of reﬂecting through the data stories, because they were able to clearly see the mistakes made during the simulation, for exam- ple: “ [data stories] highlight what you did not do [right] ” (T8, S4); and “ [the data stories] show both what we did and what we were meant to do ” (T8, S4). Some DS elements and their usefulness were emphasized by students during their reﬂections. For example, two teams mentioned that enclosing and colored regions helped them to understand the expected timeframe in which they were meant to perform certain actions, and ﬁve teams agreed that the annotations informed them about how they could act upon the information: “ It is not just that we were late but we were late by that much time, so we can precisely see what we have to improve, and what we have done well. [The data stories] make a big difference ” (T1, S2). Students also commented on the designs of the prototypes (V1, shown in Fig. 7 and V2, shown in Fig. 8) and commented on how the design decisions impacted the interpretability. Three out of the ﬁve teams in Study 2 found that V2 was less complex than V1. Students explained their preference in terms of the simplicity of V2 to more quickly digest the arousal data, compared to looking at every arousal peak in V1."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"In the next section, we report more in detail how students used the data stories to reﬂect on the simulation, and anticipated usage strategies. B. Anticipated Usage Strategies This section is divided into three parts, presenting antici- pated usage opportunities of the data stories regarding i) errors made, ii) arousal, and iii) the storytelling tool as a whole. 1) Use of the Tool for Reﬂection on Errors : Students in seven of the nine teams considered that the data stories on errors provided them with the opportunity to improve their clinical practice. For example, one student stated that the data stories “ showed [them] what [they] did well and what [they] should have done to improve ” (T3, S4). Some students men- tioned that each data story helped the team to focus on improvements to be made. This was stated by one student as follows: “ [the data stories] help us to reﬂect on practical ways to improve and work as a team ” (T3, S5). They expressed that seeing their actual performance, with errors highlighted, made them think about speciﬁc skills and knowledge they need to master. One student said: “ [the data stories] highlighted areas where I need to strengthen my clinical thinking ” (T2, S4). Another student more speciﬁcally listed the kind of skills she had to strengthen as a result of her reﬂections: “ [the data sto- ries] showed me that I need more knowledge about PAC [post anaesthetic care] nursing, I need more knowledge about gain- ing trust in postoperative, hypertension etc. ” (T2, S2). Students suggested some strategies for making use of the storytelling tool. For example, some of the students’ reﬂections were quite individualized, suggesting potential uses of the tool to support individual reﬂection or reﬂection on particular roles (three teams)."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"For example, a student envisaged how the tutor could help them to go through the data stories toreﬂect on further medical conditions and procedures as fol- lows, which is not possible at present for logistical reasons: “The tutor can actually explain things, if you have something to go off. Usually we do our sim and then we forget about it and never look at it again, or they [tutors] would not know what we have done anyway, because they are not watching each person ” (T7, S3). In addition, students in ﬁve teams mentioned the possibility of using the tool for the assessment of their performance and the actions they are intended to perform when enacting certain roles. However, most students (in six teams) preferred the tool to be used to enhance the provision of feedback (formative assessment) as opposed to perform automated summative assessments."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"Accountability and Privacy Discussions about reﬂecting on the data stories and the medi- ating role of teachers was a matter of concern for some stu- dents. Students in six teams mentioned that debriefs guided by the data stories could provide a better team discussion, even without the teacher, and that they were willing to compare their performance with other teams (six out of nine teams) and “ see what each group member did ” (T3, S3). However, students in these teams agreed that this social comparison should be led by the tutor: “ Do not just give it to the student, get the tutor to sit down with the group and talk it through ” (T3, S3). Students were asked to explain their views about sharing their data with other students, tutors, or teams. Students in all teams agreed that it would be ﬁne to share their timeline with other students, especially “ If it helps [other groups] ” (T3, S2) to reﬂect on their mistakes."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"Explainability of the Rules When students (only the ﬁve teams of Sim 2) were exposed to the rules used to craft the data stories, most students men- tioned feeling confused, and hesitated to respond [e.g., “ You mean all those boxes? I am a bit confused ” (T9, S5)]. Students in three teams requested further explanations, for example: “ If you [interviewer] do not explain it, how long would it take to understand this stuff? ” (T9, S4). Other students judged that the rules needed some basic coding skills to be fully understood [e.g., “ If you do not know coding, it is hard to understand ” (T9, S4)]."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"Like it is [data stories] feedback or what- ever it is called, it should be constructive ” (T8, S1). The rest of the students (in teams 5 and 9) mentioned that they would not ﬁnd the rules useful and that they would not try to change the rules [“ I would like to keep [the parameters] like that ” (T9, S1)]. Two students stated that teachers would be in a better position to “ understand the parameters ” (T5, S2) and that they would also need “ basic [concepts of] coding ” (T8, S1) to change them. Interestingly, in the survey (see Fig. 10), students rated the explanations in the rules layer as mostly useful (tenstudents) and very useful (ﬁve students)."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"The careful alignment of data stories created from the analysis of students’ data, with the learning intentions of the activity, offers rich opportunities to support students and to identify potential changes needed in the learning designs. Future work should explore these opportunities in other educational contexts. In addition, more experimental studies could be conducted to identify which speciﬁc elements of the LA interface drive students’ visual attention (e.g., such as the study using eye- trackers conducted by Echeverria et al. [27]). B."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"Firstly, the data stories provide a prescriptive way to com- municate insights from data. In doing so, the risk of over inter- pretation is evident. Students did not explicitly mention potential issues related to bias in our prototypes. However, students could have questioned how their arousal levels were determined or whether the errors made were correctly detected."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data story,"To mitigate this risk, in our studies each data story was carefully aligned to the teacher’s learning intentions. Yet, further research should investigate the impact of differences in the way the data are modeled and how stories are presented. This involves, for example, investigating the impact of model- ing arousal data using alternative heuristics to convert peaks into categories or presenting the insights using different com- binations of text narrative and visual enhancements. The most questioned feature in the designs was the exposure of the semiformal “pseudocode” if-then rules."
A100,Storytelling With Learner Data: Guiding Student Reflection on Multimodal Team Data,1,1,data stories,"Secondly, while the evidence from these design prototypes builds our conﬁdence that they effec- tively provoke students’ reﬂections, and the DS techniques have been designed from the start to be automatable, the gener- ation of data stories from multimodal data is not yet fully auto- mated. The timeline of actions is automated and can be shown to students instantly after they complete the classroom task, but the integration of data captured from different modalities still requires some human intervention (e.g., running algorithms separately to model the data and semiautomatically crafting the stories). This is a challenge that forms an important part of the wider research agenda in MMLA research. [29]. VIII."

As mentioned in the literature review, it is na €ıve to expect that students will be able to interpret data and make them actionable without further assistance. DS can be a promising approach to facilitate such assistance and to augment teacher-led reﬂection. This article presented two qualitative studies conducted in authentic nurs- ing simulation classrooms with the purpose of communicating insights to students through data stories . Given the limitations of current visual analytics, we anticipate that approaches such as DS will grow in importance to help students make the most of the new forms of feedback that are becoming possible.

While a handful of previous stud-ies have examined what characterises aspects of data storytelling like narratives and visualisa-tion or analysis based on single cases, we are yet to see a systematic effort to harness these available resources to gain better insight into what characterises good data stories and how these are created. This study analysed 44 cases of outstanding data storytelling practices com-prising winning entries of the Global Editors Network’s Data Journalism Award from 2013 to2016 to bridge this knowledge gap. Based on a conceptual model we developed, we uniformlycharacterised each of the 44 cases and then proceeded to determine types of these stories andthe nature of technologies employed in creating them. Our findings refine the traditional typol-ogy of data stories from the journalistic perspective and also identify core technologies andtools that appear central to good data journalism practice. We also discuss our findings in relations to the recently published 2017 winning entries. Our results have significant implica- tions for the required competencies for data journalists in contemporary and futurenewsrooms. KEYWORDS data-driven journalism; data journalism skills; data journalism tools; data story; data storytelling types; Global Editor Network Introduction Data journalism is an aspect of contemporary journalism in which techniques such as data analytics, programming and narrative visualisation are employed in addi- tional to traditional journalistic methods to create data stories (Appelgren and Nygren 2014 ). Data stories are artefacts for revealing and communicating insights gained from the analysis of data-sets obtained from the public domain, crowdsourcing or big datasources. Data storytelling (i.e. the practice of creating data stories) is a structured approach comprising data, visuals and narratives for communicating insights from data (Dykes 2016 ). The object of developing data stories is to give voice to the data to inform, explain, persuade or engage the target audience (Slaney 2012 ). Digital Journalism , 2017 https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2017.1403291 /C2112017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   Despite the rapidly growing popularity of data journalism (Hewett 2015 ) and its adoption by large media organisations such as The Times, The Washington Post andThe Guardian (Segel and Heer 2010 ), scholarly publications on data storytelling are lim- ited. For instance, a search on Google Scholar for the term “data storytelling” in early July 2016 returned only 202 documents. The same search returned 316 documents in April 2017, which illustrated the growing interest in the field in the previous year. A similar Google Scholar search on “data journalism” returned 2910 documents in April 2017, 639 of which are produced since the beginning of 2016. Similarly, a search on the Scopus bibliographic database in April 2017 returned only 13 documents listed as containing the phrase “data storytelling” in their titles, abstracts or keywords and 83 documents for those mentioning “data journalism”. This compares to more than 68,000publications returned by Google Scholar using the search terms “data analytics” and 148,000 for “data science” and just over 5000 documents and 1300 documents on Sco- pus, respectively. Thus, roughly 0.5–4 per cent of the research attention in data analyt- ics and science is devoted to data journalism and data storytelling—arguably one of its most valuable aspects. Despite this paucity, there are a few notable publications on data storytelling (Segel and Heer 2010 ) and (Lee et al. 2015 ) which identify core ele- ments and rigorously describe the design space for data stories and narrative visualisa- tions. Other works have attempted to prescribe good data story practices (Alexander and Vetere 2011 ) and analysed concrete data storytelling practices (Pouchard, Barton, and Zilinski 2014 ). In addition, few practitioner-directed articles such as (Stikeleather 2013 ) that have sought to contribute good storytelling practices. The Global Editors Network (GEN) a cross-platform community for editors and media innovators (GEN 2016 ) has recognised outstanding practice in Data Journalism since 2012. The winning entries are presented on their community portal (community.- globalnetwork.org)."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data storytelling,"In our opinion, this repository of good practice constitutes an invaluable source of information for deconstructing data storytelling to produce more systematised knowledge about options for developing different types of data stories. One of the first steps in undertaking this challenge is to develop a conceptual frame- work for characterising data storytelling. Such a framework should enable the user to answer basic journalistic questions about the data story cases regarding “who, what,where, why, when and how” (5W-1H) from the resulting knowledgebase. In a recent work Young, Hermida, and Fulda ( 2017 ), the authors analysed the nature and quality of the subset of all Canadian finalists and winners in this repository between 2012 and 2015. This study provides complementary analysis of GEN winning entries with the goal of better understanding the nature or type of data stories in the repository and how different technologies are being combined to create data stories. To this end, we devel- oped a conceptual framework based on extant literature and then applied the frame- work to describe 44 data storytelling cases recognised as outstanding in Data Journalism (DJA) Award from 2012 to 2016. The resulting repository of cases was anal- ysed using a multi-case approach (Baxter and Jack 2008 ) and content analysis. Findings from our work refine the traditional “typology of intent” of data stories in particular inform and explain (Slaney 2012 ) from the journalistic perspective. The findings also provide a “Data Journalism Technology Competency Architecture” for training and development of the future data journalist, configuration of teams working and dynam- ics in contemporary and future newsrooms.2 ADEGBOYEGA OJO AND BAHAREH HERAVI Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   Conceptual Foundation Data journalism could be described as the “application of data science to journal- ism, where data science is defined as the study of the extraction of knowledge fromdata” (Howard 2014 ). Howard ( 2014 ) further explains that data journalism encompasses “gathering, cleaning, organising, analysing, visualising, and publishing data to support the creation of acts of journalism”. A similar definition for the discipline of data journal- ism is provided in Berret and Phillips ( 2016 ) as a “field [that] encompasses a suite of practices for collecting, analysing, visualising, and publishing data for journalistic pur- poses”."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data storytelling,"Data are at the heart of data storytelling. Kitchin ( 2014 ) describes data as raw ele- ments that are abstracted from phenomena and measured and recorded in different ways. In the most accurate sense, data are actually those elements that have been selected and harvested from all possible data—“as such, data are inherently partial, selective and representative, and the distinguishing criteria used in their capture has consequence” (Kitchin 2014 ).In common use, data are characterised as unprocessed, abstract, discrete and aggregative. Data can be captured directly through some form of measurement from observations, experiments and records or produced by devices as by-products (exhaust) of their main function."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data storytelling,"In these cases, data are usually the deliberate productPATTERNS IN AWARD WINNING DATA STORYTELLING 3 Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   of measurement; that is, the intention was to generate useful data. Exhaust data are inherently produced by a device or system as a by-product of the main function ratherthan the primary output (Manyika et al. 2011 ). In addition to the source of data, there are other typologies for data based on form (quantitative versus qualitative), structure (structured versus unstructured) and type (indexical, attribute and metadata) and type (numerical, textual, spatial, networked and temporal) (Kitchin 2014 ; Manyika et al. 2011 ). Telling stories from data or “data storytelling” is central to the practice of data journalism. Stories are fundamental components of human experience (Slaney 2012 ). They are mechanisms for communicating information in a psychologically efficient for- mat (Segel and Heer 2010 ). Like stories, a data story comprises a set of story pieces which are backed up with specific facts and are often visualised to support one or more intended messages (Lee et al. 2015 ). According to the same authors, the story pieces making up a data story are presented in a meaningful order (i.e. creating the plot) to achieve the intended author’s high-level goals which include educating or entertaining the viewers, convincing and persuading the audience with thought-pro- voking opinions. According to Slaney ( 2012 ), authors of data stories may also be inter- ested in comforting, entertain, terrorise or inform the intended audience. The notion of story pieces and required ordering of these pieces into a (data) story is consistent with the fundamental nature of stories. Stories or those stories that are considered meaningful have specific narrative structures that are recognisable by an audience (Rayfield 1972 ). In fact, stories have certain structure could be used to legitimately recognise it as such (Rayfield 1972 )."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data story,"This rigorous characterisation could be useful in delineating what a data story is and what it is not. For instance, Lee et al. ( 2015 ) in describing what they considered as a data story in their work indicated that web-based interactive visu- alisations that support completely free exploration without guidance is not consideredas a data story nor are charts posted on the web with no written explanations and annotations that help the reader to capture the intended message. Data storytelling could be described as the act of creating and communicating data stories. Lee et al. ( 2015 ) characterised the visual data storytelling process as com- prising three major phases—exploring data, making a story and telling a story. Explo- ration of data comprises activities centred on exploratory analysis to collect data excerpts containing derived insights from data, variations, or quick externalisation of data. For instance the Google Sheet Explore feature provides this type of analysis to summarise and identify variations or outliers in data. The story making is achieved over a number of iterations and involves constructing a storyline or plot to fit the data excerpts generated in the exploration phase (Lee et al. 2015 )."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data storytelling,"Specifically, the reviewed works examined the evolving skill-set and compe- tences required for data journalism and data storytelling and adoption pattern by newsrooms. Fink and Anderson ( 2015 ) in particular found that larger news organisa- tions in general have higher level of technically skilled data journalists, and thus able to develop more interesting data stories. Parasie and Dagiral ( 2013 ) also reported that integrating programmers into newsrooms opens up the technology-driven innovation potentials of news organisations. This category of work is complemented with the body of research on visualisation, and narrative visualisations such as those reported in Segeland Heer ( 2010 ) and Lee et al. ( 2015 ). Table 1highlights key data storytelling concepts described above. While past studies have looked into aspects of the skills required or currently held by data journalists in newsrooms, barriers to good data storytelling in the studies news- rooms as well as insight into the practice of data journalism they are yet to specificallyPATTERNS IN AWARD WINNING DATA STORYTELLING 5 Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   study the characteristics of “good data storytelling/journalism”, required competences for developing high-quality data stories, or specific tools or techniques used in data jour-nalism work. We believe the only study that attempted to examine characteristics of good data storytelling, with a similar cohort of data, is Young, Hermida, and Fulda ( 2017 ). Unlike our study that looks into winning entries globally, Young, Hermida, and Fulda ( 2017 ) study the shortlisted entries that originated from Canada in three different journalism awards, including the GEN Data Journalism Awards, between 2012 and 2015. In their study they looked into 26 cases and examined the quality of the Canadian short- listed entries in terms of the quality of tools used, the diversity of the team involved in the projects, interactivity of the stories and the visual elements used. While Young, Hermida, and Fulda ( 2017 ) study has a narrower scope than the study in hand in terms of diversity of cases and their quality; given that they were shortlisted cases and not winning cases, certain aspects of their findings are not far from our findings as shown in the discussion section.TABLE 1 Design space and options for data storytelling from literature Aspect Options Reference Purpose Inform, Persuade, Entertain, Comfort, Explain, TerroriseLee et al.

Specifically, we could inquire about the specific types of data stories or narratives that appear to better engage the audience and what it takes to create such stories. The GEN, a cross-platform community of editors-in-chief and media innovators 1launched the Data Journalism Award in 2012 as an annual series of events to recognise outstanding projects in data journalism. Since then, awards have been given to about 50 projects from large newsrooms, small newsrooms and individu- als on theme related to investigative journalism, data visualisation, data journalism web- site, open data award, best use of data in breaking news and news data apps. The winning entries over the years collectively provide examples of how the use of datastories is shifting the frontiers of the practice of journalism."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data story,"In our opinion, a systematic capture of these descriptions could provide a rich stock of best practice exemplars that could be analysed to provide concrete answers to following research questions: RQ1: What data story types are characteristic of the winning entries in data Journalism Awards? RQ2: How are the different technologies combined (or used together) to create these compelling data stories? We explain below our approach to answering these questions. Specifically, we describe how we curated a data-set describing core elements of the data story cases, and how we carried out both exploratory and explanatory analyses of the stories to answer the above questions. Curating the GEN Data Journalism Award Data-set The first step in our work involved curating a data-set describing core elements of the GEN Data Story cases selected as winning entries from 2013 to 2016. According to Simon Rogers, Data Journalism Awards Director,2the following five criteria were con- sidered in identifying or characterising data story entries as exemplary and a winning entry. The first criterion assesses the innovation character of the data story. It seeks to know if the piece of work is doing something new, for instance in how data is reported. The second criterion examines the “content and story” element of the entry. This criterion looks beyond producing attractive visualisation to whether if there is some compelling story being told."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data story,"It examines the journalistic aspects (including edit quality) of the data story. The third criterion is centred on how technology is used in telling the data story. It examines if the adopted technology in the case works across different media (mobile in addition to browser), and how it takes advantage of thepeculiarities of these media in telling the stories. The fourth criterion is about the con- text of the story (or plot). This criterion rewards ambitious work from war zones, devel- oping nations or other difficult situations."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data storytelling,"The fifth and last criterion re-examines the data stories to see if it exemplifies “best journalism around data”, going beyond reproducing statistics butPATTERNS IN AWARD WINNING DATA STORYTELLING 7 Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   endowing these analyses with greater meaning. An implication of these set of criteria is that at least in the GEN community, data storytelling or data journalism is first and fore-most about the journalism. About 50 cases were selected by the jurors based on these criteria from 2012 to 2016. However, we omitted entries for the year 2012 due to the sparsity of information about the cases.

A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data stories,"The case of Africa and conflict regions is interesting as these regions are story-rich and in fact, some of the settings of the winning data stories are centred on these regions. The curated data-set comprises 44 rows and the following 16 columns—Title of project or entry, the of the project description on GEN Community website, the addressof the project website, category of the entry, description of the entry, tags used in describing the entry, technology employed in developing the entry or data story, coun- try of journalist, organisation, year of submission, nature of the interactivity in the data story, targeted audience of the data story, nature of data underpinning the story, sector targeted by the story, source of the data for the story and type of the story. FIGURE 1 Source of the cases8 ADEGBOYEGA OJO AND BAHAREH HERAVI Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   Exploring the Data-set After coding each of the 44 cases, we explored the data-set to determine emerg- ing patterns in terms of: purpose of the stories, the media used for telling the stories,story types, how the stories are represented, degree of interactivity of the stories and the technology tools employed in the narrating and presenting the data stories. These patterns are presented in Table 1. We show for each element, the most common items across the 44 cases. For instance, most of the data stories are largely aimed at “inform- ing” the audience about a specific topic or phenomenon with the “web browser” as the medium of the choice. Figures 2–5provide additional information on the observed patterns with respect to the data story elements in Table 2. In general, many of the cases had more than one goal, for instance, a story may aim at informing the public and simultaneously persuading or entertaining. Specifically, Figure 2shows that about 73 per cent of the cases had as part of their goals to “in- form” the target audience (e.g. that linking metadata information about citizens’ callrecords to email, bank data, etc. is sufficient to reveal the thought and living patterns of subjects) while about 41 per cent of the stories were also interested in “persuading” the audience towards adopting some positions (e.g. persuading parents who are doubt- ful about vaccination that there vaccination programmes works. About 39 per cent of cases tried “explaining” some phenomena to the public, for instance how millions of voters that are disproportionately minorities could inadvertently be prevented from vot- ing based on the rules used by a computer programme designed to identify irregulari- ties during the election."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data story,"The overall pic-ture shows that even when the agenda of a data story is to persuade or explain; good practice may require informing the audience about the context and background of the subject matter. The level of interactivity employed in telling a data story directly affects the story experience. Figure 3shows 59 per cent of the reviewed data story cases were “interac- tive” while 27 per cent of the stories provided features for searching, filtering and selec- tion. Only 7 per cent of the cases employed map-based interactivity. Static images and graphics were used 14 per cent of the cases. Most (about 77 per cent) of the interactive features were rendered through annotated graphics and maps according to Figure 4."

A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data stories,"The first analysis involved the use of the conventional approach to content analysis (Hsieh and Shannon 2005 ) to establish the nature of the data stories and the tools used in creating the data stories. The use of conventional content analysis is suitable when existing the- ory or research literature in a domain is limited. In this approach, categories and names (codes) for categories flow from the data. One advantage of this approach is that the knowledge generated is directly drawn from the data as opposed to when categories are determined a priori based on literature or some theoretical framework."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data stories,"Using the conventional content analysis approach, categories were developed to represent the types of data stories (cases) and the different types of tools associated with the creation of these stories . The coding process is characterised by two kinds of operations; a reduc- tionist operation to establish the initial set of fine-grained categories based on story intent followed by a clustering operation to merge similar granular categories into more compact categories. The final set of categories were described over a number of cycles to improve coverage and obtain consensus. Considering the great importance attributed to the “content and story” element of data stories by the jurors and experts, the reductionist operation that produced our data story types was based on the “speci- fic purpose or intent” of each of the 44 data stories. Consequently, our final set of data FIGURE 5 What kinds of technologies are employed in developing data stories?PATTERNS IN AWARD WINNING DATA STORYTELLING 11 Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   story categories or types are directly related and indeed, refine the more abstract story purposes shown in Table 2which include inform, persuade and explain. These more specific types originating directly from journalistic practices potentially provides models that could be emulated to develop compelling data stories. In the case of our technol- ogy categories, the resulting categories provide logical groupings for the specific tech- nologies associated with the 44 cases to enable further analysis, such as technology usage pattern and dependencies (the second type analysis discussed below). Frequency counts of our data story types and technology categories are presented as summaries in Figures 7and 8. The second type of analysis includes the determining the patterns of use of the different technologies in data storytelling. More specifically, based on our data-set, weare interested in establishing how different categories of technologies tend to be used together in the same project and dependencies among these tools. For this purpose, we mine association rules (Zhao 2003 ) and implication rules (Godin and Missaoui 1994 ) in our data-set using the “ConExp” tool.3The ConExp tool is a research tool developed for the analysis of simple attribute-object tables and exploration of the different depen- dencies that exist among attributes. In our case, the objects were the different data story projects and the attributes comprise the different categories of technologies employed in these projects (see Figure 6)."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data story,"Our goal is to analyse the dependencies in the use of the different categories of technologies when carrying out data story pro- jects. This information will provide us with the set of technologies that are often used together in data story projects. It also allows us to determine the consequence of usinga technology or set of technologies. FIGURE 6 Screenshot of our data-set displayed in the ConExp Tool12 ADEGBOYEGA OJO AND BAHAREH HERAVI Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   Findings This section reveals and describes the different story types discovered across the case, the prevalence and use of different technologies across projects and the patternsof usage of these technologies. The Types After a careful analysis of the themes and purpose or intent of the data stories projects, we identified seven Types comprising: Refute Claims, Reveal unintended con-sequences, Reveal information of personal interest, Enable deeper understanding of a phenomenon, Reveal anomalies and deficiencies in Systems Track changes in systems, and Reveal information about an entity in increasing levels of details. These categories are defined with examples in Table 3. While types like “revealing anomalies and defi- ciencies in systems”, “revealing unintended consequences” and “refuting claims” are investigative in nature, others types easily find applications in areas of public education and advocacy (e.g. enabling a deeper understanding of a phenomenon). The “track changes” in systems” is particularly generic theme for monitoring and has wide applica- bility beyond the transparency contexts such as in the case study involving the tracking of the wealth of politicians serving in public offices in Argentina to performance moni- toring of services and infrastructures in cities."

Following the iterative content analysis process described in the methodology section, we identi-fied 12 categories of tools employed across the 44 cases. These categories include Web Development and Publishing; Data Analysis; Data Visualisation; Map Visualisation; Data- bases; Social Media; Data Preparation and Wrangling; Graph Editor and Publishing; Video Editing and Processing; Data Scrapping; Data and Content Management plat- forms and General Programming. We briefly describe each of these categories below and provide concrete examples of these categories from our data-set. Web Development and Publishing —These are tools and technologies that are used for web-based application programming, development and publishing."

The figure identifies the three core technologies and two sets of supporting technologies: web development and publishing ,data visualisation and data analysis . These are considered to be the core skills needed in newsrooms for data journalism projects, or in other words the most crucial skills to be expected from data journalists to hold.

The study examined the quality of the shortlisted projects that originated from Canada from 2012 to 2015 in terms of the quality of tools used, the diversity of the team involved in the projects, interactivity of the stories and the visual elements used. Although Young, Hermida, and Fulda ( 2017 ) examined short- listed entries only from Canada, and while there was only one common case between the two studies (Vancouver Sun one of the winners of the GEN Data Journalism Awards in 2014), the information in Table 1largely agrees with conclusions in their work regarding the use of annotated graph/maps and videos as the primary visual elements or representation in reviewed data stories. Regarding data story types, several authors have attempted to provide one or more typologies for data stories. The closest to our typology is the typology presented in Slaney ( 2012 ) comprising four types inform, explain, persuade and entertain, subset of which is shown as common purposes of data stories in Table 2. Our typology which comprises 7 types and presented in Table 3are also based the intent, purpose or essence of a story. As explained in the method section, the basis for our decision to characterise the stories based on their intent is based on the importance attributed to this facet of data storytelling by expert jurors of the Data Journalism Award. In our opinion, a typology based on a core facet of compelling or winning stories offers concrete models for emulation in practice and for further investigation. When compared with the 4 types in Slaney ( 2012 ), our 7 types are sub-types of the “inform” and “explain” types. This relationship is shown in first column of Table 5."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data stories,"In addition, we observe that the typologies presented in Kang ( 2015 ) and Gray, Chambers, and Bounegru ( 2012 ) are based on the nature of analyses that underpin data stories, hence we refer to both typologies as providing Analytical types . Specifi- cally, seven types of stories are described in Kang ( 2015 ) including Narrating change over time, Start Big and Drill Down, Start small and zoom out, Highlight Contrast, Explore the intersection, Dissect the factors and Profile the outliers. The Handbook of Data Journalism (Gray, Chambers, and Bounegru 2012 ) identified 8 types of data stories comprising: measurement or counting, proportion, internal comparison, external com- parison, change over time, league table, analysis by category and associations. Thistypology which is also analysis-centric appears to present some form of order in terms of complexity of the underpinning analysis types; starting with counting at the low end and stories based on league tables and associations at the high end. In another article published in the Harvard Business Review (Davenport 2014 ), a multi-dimensional typology of stories were identified based on four key dimensions including time—is the story about past, present or future; focus—type of question to being answered by the story, what, why or how?; depth—the level of investigation involved in the story; and method—the nature of the statistical analysis. Based on this four dimension, Davenport ( 2014 ) identified the following stories types: three time- based types which are reporting ,explanatory survey and predictions stories; three focus- based types including what ,why and how to address this issue stories; two depth-based stories which include “CSI” and “Eureka” stories and finally two Methods-based storiesPATTERNS IN AWARD WINNING DATA STORYTELLING 19 Downloaded by [University of Oregon] at 11:19 03 December 2017   TABLE 5 Relating data stories typologies Type 1—Intent (Slaney 2012 ) Type 2—Analytical (Kang 2015 )Type 3—Analytical (Gray, Chambers, and Bounegru 2012 )Type—4 Multidimensional (Davenport 2014 ) Inform  Refute Claim  Reveal unintended consequences Reveal anomalies/deficiencies Track changes in system  Reveal information of interest Narrating change over time  Start big and drill down Start small and Zoom in Highlight Contrast  Explore intersection  Dissect Factors Profile outliers Measurement or counting  Proportion Internal comparison External Comparison  Change over time  League table Analysis by category  AssociationTime Past—Reporting Present—Explanatory Future—Predictive Explain  Enable deeper understanding  Reveal information in increasing detailsFocus What?

A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data story,"If we consider in particular our intent typology and the two analytical typologies described above as some form of data story design patterns , the three typologies could be used complementarily to construct a data story design space as shown in Figure 9. Such design space provides concrete mechanisms and strategies (analytical types) to realise compelling data stories characterised by our intent types. For instance two of analytical types in Kang ( 2015 ) can be directly associated with the mechanisms for two of our intent types in Table 3—Narrating change over time ( Track changes in systems ) and Start Big and Drill Down ( Reveal information about an entity in increasing level of details ). Similarly, Gray, Chambers, and Bounegru ( 2012 ) analytical types and Davenport (2014 ) methods could be employed as mechanisms to realise our intent types. Another major implication of our results is the pre-eminence of the web tech- nologies along with data visualisation and data analysis tools for data storytelling. Based on empirical analysis, we have provided in Figure 10the technology use pattern across the data journalism projects reviewed. These results show that contemporary and future data journalism practices require a team with computation and program- ming skills, data analysis skills and data visualisation skills, in addition to traditional jour- nalism skills. Specifically, the availability of database, map visualisation, social media, data preparation and wrangling and data scrapping skills are very important in addition to web development, data visualisation and data analysis for mature data journalismpractices."

We observed that our seven types adequately characterised the 12 new stories in terms of their purpose. In terms of inter- activity, 75 per cent of the 2017 entries were interactive while 33 per cent provided search, filtering and selection features. This is largely consistent with the patterns weobtained from the analysis of the original 44 cases (59 per cent interactive and 27 per cent search, filter and selection)."
A101,"Patterns in Award Winning Data Storytelling: Story Types, Enabling Tools and Competences",1,1,data story,"To this end, we consider how our findings may collectively characterise a compelling or high- quality data story. While the DJA director specified a number of criteria for selecting the winning stories (see method section), our finding provide more specific features to characterise what we may call “data story or data journalism ideal types” (Doty andGlick 1994 ) in terms of intent, interactivity, representation style and use of technology. From our findings, the ideal data story and journalism type will tend to (1) have one or a more of our seven intents, (2) provide a high degree of interactivity or search, filter- ing and selection features, (3) employ annotated graphs, charts and maps with videos and (4) implemented using web development tools in addition to data and visual ana- lytics tools suitable for presentation over a variety of channels. We nevertheless caution that this is just one of the emerging perspectives on what constitutes good data story- telling or journalism. This perspective is centred on the primacy of journalistic features in data journalism and sees the data, digital or computational aspects as only providinga supporting role in data journalism practice. Other viewpoints are emerging. One such alternative viewpoint s discussed in a recent blog which considered the depth of data analysis involved in the data journalism to be central to quality data journalism practice (Dickinson 2017 )."

In search for best practices for data storytelling and as a result high-quality data journalism work, this study analysed 44 cases of award-winning data journalism work, comprising winning entries of the GEN’s Data Journalism Award from 2013 to 2016. It further presents a conceptual model using which we uniformly characterised each of the 44 cases to determine types of these stories, the nature of technologies, and skills employed in creating these sto- ries. Regarding our two research questions stated in the method section, our findings show that: 1. Seven types of data stories characterise the 44 winning projects in our study based on their theme or intent. A quarter of our winning stories were categorised asexplaining a Phenomenon for deeper understanding type, followed by cases related to revealing anomalies in systems and revealing information of personal interest types. 2. W eb development and publishing ,data analysis and data visualisation are the core technologies needed in creating successful data stories. These three categories oftechnologies appear to be the most important skills for data journalism and news- rooms aiming at successful data journalism work. Database, map visualisation, social media, data wrangling and data scrapping tools are also important supporting tools in these projects. 3. In our opinion, our findings contribute to the growing discussion of what constitutes good data storytelling and journalism. However, we also note that improving our understanding of what constitutes quality data storytelling and journalism requires going beyond the analysis of the secondary data on the data storytelling and jour- nalism projects as we have done in this study. We believe that having direct access to some of the winning teams and interviewing them should offer deeper and sig- nificantly richer insight into beliefs, processes and dynamics of creating high qualityand compelling data stories.

A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"Methodology: Using “unblackboxing,” a combination of narrative and critical data studies methods, I analyzed the Fatal Force database and its accompanying data stories. I compare this database with its institutional counterpart in the FBI’s ﬂedgling Use of Force database. Results: Fatal Force is constructed with particular attention to questions that users may have about police brutality, police shootings, and race. Fatal Force’s data stories use narrative commonplaces like sociality and temporality to humanize the issue of police use of force and communicate greater nuance. The FBI’s Use of Force database shows an orientation toward police perceptions of use-of-force incidents and a lack of attention to national conversations about police brutality. Conclusions: Data systems show clear perspectives on the issues that they describe, which inﬂuence how users encounter the data system, how useful the system can be for various users, and how inclusive or just the data system is. Index Terms— Data system design, narrative, rhetorics of data, unblackboxing."
A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"How do data collection, aggregation, and curation practices inﬂuence data stories about crime and violence? RQ2. How does Fatal Force, a data system about police use of force that originated outside law enforcement, prioritize and organize information? RQ3."
A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"Clandinin’s commonplaces are all about ﬁnding common axes of connection between personal, “cultural, social, institutional, familial, and linguistic” inﬂuences on experience [43, p.40]—researchers can use them as a heuristic for reading data stories across documents [40]. In addition to lending themselves well to social justice work, these commonplaces are ﬂexible and adaptable enough to work for reading more than just typical narratives with characters and plot. Given that unblackboxing needs to ﬂex to work for various kinds of data systems, the kinds of narratives that researchers might encounter vary widely from traditional to totally implicit and nontraditional. In other words, Clandinin’s commonplaces are more likely to still serve as a useful heuristic for even the most technical, “objective” data stories. Phase 2 answers the questions listed in Table II, which can be adapted or speciﬁed for a particular case. Each question in this list gets at one or more of the three goals of this phase: connections, perspectives, and actors. Each system is different enough that one set of guiding questions will not work similarly enough across systems."
A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"To determine which data stories I would analyze for Phase 2, I ﬁrst included reporting that was linkedon the database itself because these stories are most closely linked with the data for users. I then expanded the document set to include some of the articles from the Post’s Police Brutality section. Finally, I searched the exact phrase “fatal force” on thePost archive as a whole and included any article whose title indicated it focused on data about police brutality or police shootings. For both the Police Brutality section articles and the articles retrieved via search, I included only articles that focused on broader claims about police shootings and their circumstances."
A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"Implicit narrative in the Fatal Force data stories is usually couched between explicit narratives—in this example, several explicit narratives are covered in a sentence or two, to show a pattern across unique incidents, and each explicit narrative gets marked by place and sociality, though temporality is mostly elided. Implicit narrative in one exemplar piece on shootings of unarmed Black men makes some key moves that are echoed in other examples in the data system [55]. The ﬁrst is counting— authors explicitly name and emphasize the number of the dead. This continues as authors begin to describe the frequency of incidents (every nine days, three shootings in two weeks)."
A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"But implicit narratives still tell stories that can be constructed; this example’s story reads something like unarmed Black men are shot and killed by police with alarming frequency, and though it looks like other groups have it worse ‘by the numbers,’ the truth about how much more danger Black men face than other races is even worse than you thought. [55]The key difference in commonplaces between implicit and explicit narratives in these data stories is that implicit narratives rarely include elements of place—they focus speciﬁcally on sociality and, to a slightly lesser degree, on temporality. Explicit narratives typically feature place heavily, even if only to ground the story—and although they also include sociality and temporality like implicit narratives, the ways that these commonplaces manifest tend to diverge. Implicit narratives use sociality in more global or large-scale ways, describing groups rather than individuals, while explicit narratives use it to communicate information about individual people, their relatives, and their relationship with the world and people around them. These rhetorical moves match up with the dichotomy of purpose between these two narrative types (implicit functions to critique powerful institutions; explicit functions to humanize and facilitate empathy)."
A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"Fatal Force data stories, however, add temporality back in—not just the date of the death, which is already in the database, but the series of events and their temporal relationship to one another. Stories can convey how fast something occurred, or how slow, as in the case of Dentmond’s story described earlier, which speciﬁcally noted that Dentmond hesitated for 24 minutes between ofﬁcers telling him to drop his (replica) weapon and his advancing on them with it [54]. The database ﬂattens the story of each line, each shooting, into one moment—as the cards in the web-based interactive database all read, a person of a given race and gender, armed or unarmed, was shot in a place on a date. Data stories give these events their time back. Data stories also typically include a great deal of more information about the people who were shot and often even include the words of those who loved them. This is a clear move to embed shooting victims in the world and in social networks, both to humanize these data and to build empathy.

A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"However, most of the data stories surrounding the database and comprising the data system add information that makes up for that lack by putting the tallied killings in the context of the country’s demographic breakdown. FBI Use-of-Force The FBI began its National Use-of-Force Data Collection with a pilot study in 2017, two years after the start of the Fatal Force database. The Use-of-Force database was not used in earnest, however, until 2019 [53]. The FBI’s Use-of-Force data, like Fatal Force, are collected in response to growing social awareness of police use and misuse of force; unlike Fatal Force, however, the FBI’s data do not name any of the high-proﬁle killings or protests in the last decade nor are Black Lives Matter or other organizations focusing on police brutality mentioned at all."
A103,Toward Data Justice: Understanding Police Shooting Data Systems and Narratives,1,1,data stories,"Fatal Force, as an entire system including database and data stories, was designed to address social inequities as they manifest in policing and police violence, from the perspective of citizens, community members, and allies. The FBI’s use-of-force database, which has not yet released much information to the public at all, was designed “for the purpose of compiling national statistics” [53, p. 2] or “to promote more open and informed conversations regarding law enforcement use offorce in the United States” [53, p. 1], from the perspective of law enforcement institutions and police ofﬁcers [53]. It seems clear that the Fatal Force system is better geared toward users encountering the system and looking for answers. The Fatal Force database is augmented with qualitative data in the form of data visualization, journalism, and investigative reporting that goes along with the database—these data stories draw from the trends that the database can show, and adding context that acknowledges and centers social justice issues. For example, Fatal Force clearly shows that more White Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Downloaded on July 19,2023 at 08:09:52 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Connected door locks, light bulbs, cameras, and thermostats are often presented through their functionality: automated, hands off and even magical ways to control mundane tasks and maintenance around the home. With a growing number of IoT devices [2, 9, 18], the amount of data collected, aggregated, and analyzed is also growing exponentially. Yet, this data is often left in the background, ignored, or in - accessible to the everyday user—the people who themselves  are at the center of this data."
A106,ListeningCups: A Case of Data Tactility and Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"In this pictorial, we make two proposals based on our work with the data driven 3D printed ListeningCups: data tactility and data stories.Data Tactility : By giving a physical shape to the data col - lected over time in the form of a familiar and highly tactile functional object, we hope to spur imagination, memory, and reflection. Bringing back this tactile data to environments of daily life—from which the data was collected in the first place—allows the user to live with the new material object and the data itself. Textures and material qualities of the artifact are revealed, may be contemplated, and reflected upon through a direct experience of touch. The experience, through many different modalities, has the potential to cre-ate a space to engage with data differently, through curiosity, emotion, and investigative practices."
A106,ListeningCups: A Case of Data Tactility and Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"Data Stories : Tactile data artifacts hold many narrative lay - ers [16, 20, 27], including stories of data collection, data tran - scription, material fabrication, and everyday use. While the  designer’s, maker’s, or craftsperson’s technical and aesthetic biases as well as the physical manipulation of the materials during the hands-on process will change many aspects of how the data is encountered in physical from, it is ultimately up to users to give life to those stories, for themselves, or for others. The concepts of data tactility and data stories are the result  of a collaborative research pilot project between an inter -action design researcher (Desjardins) and a ceramic artist (Tihanyi). Together, we created The ListeningCups: a set of 3D printed porcelain cups whose textures (a series of small bumps) represent snippets of sound recorded in various spaces. During a week-long residency at Slip Rabbit Studio, a digital ceramics lab, we developed a workflow for capturing ambient sound data, transcribing the volume levels (deci-bels) into machine code information (G-code), which then produced a texture on a Potterbot7 ceramic 3D printer. To promote functionality, we finished the porcelain pieces with  glaze and fired them to vitreous temperature of 2160   degrees F."
A106,ListeningCups: A Case of Data Tactility and Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"We conclude by articulating two main lessons from our work that could be generative and inspirational for other designers, artists, data scientists, and researchers in the DIS community: the value of data tactility and the importance of data stories. Sonification DIS ’19, June 23–28, 2019, San Diego, CA, USA 148 RELATED WORKS AND PRECEDENTS Our work builds on and expands works in the areas of data  physicalization and 3D printed ceramics. Data physicalization Akin to data visualization, data physicalization aims at transforming data sets into physical data-driven objects, in order to support exploration, understandings, and com - munication. Jansen et al. define data physicalizations as “ a  physical artifact whose geometry or material properties encode data” [14:3228]."
A106,ListeningCups: A Case of Data Tactility and Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"While cups created with both scales were based on the same  raw data, the resulting cups looked and felt different, but also supported dramatically different types of data stories. One had stories about the sensor and a gradual scale (a small bump was a soft sound; a big bump was a loud sound), the other was about humans in the space (big bumps highlight - ing the human conversation range). Of course, there is no way of knowing if sounds at 60-65 dB were in fact human conversations, but it opens an imaginary space around what stories are behind the various ambient sounds in a space. In addition to experimenting with  scales, we also played with how we ordered the data."
A106,ListeningCups: A Case of Data Tactility and Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"Data stories: Subjectivity and fiction Once glazed, the cups are open for interpretation, as we have described in the section ‘Hints towards use’. These future interpretations will be responding to the captured interpreta - tions and subjectivity that are already embedded in the cups themselves. In fact, underlying the account of our process in this pictorial lies a narrative revealing data’s susceptibility to subjectivity. The process of data transcription—captur - ing, organizing, mapping and materializing the data—was filled with decisions we, as designer and artist, made."
A106,ListeningCups: A Case of Data Tactility and Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"To further explore this tension, on the last day of the resi- dency, Desjardins purposefully changed some data points by hand in the G-code, creating ‘fictional ‘data, with the poten-tial of supporting fictional data stories. Invented data, falsi - fied data or accidental data (as we presented above) remind us that, through tactility, data is also rendered a malleable material, opening possibilities for imagination and interpre-tation. Missing bumps might represent sounds one wanted to forget or erase from the record. Fabricated bumps might reveal rhythms one aspires to reproduce in their own space."
A106,ListeningCups: A Case of Data Tactility and Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"While data stories from IoT devices are expected to be ‘right’ or ‘real’, our work with the ListeningCups shows that the fo - cus can shift to the ways people might recount these stories, or the ways they might imagine past events (real or not). The variety of cups created from the one dataset Desjardins col - lected also invites our imagination to run wild: every person will likely to tell a different story with their data set. Our work contributes a starting point to discuss how data  stories are crafted through subjectivity in the making process and in the imaginative ways people engage with the data physicalizations. We invite designers, artists, and researchers to consider bespoke and unique approaches when experimenting with IoT (or other) datasets to support individual and situated data stories. DISCUSSION  In this pictorial, we have presented the ListeningCups: 3D printed porcelain cups that embody and represent, through small bumps, ambient sound data. As we reflect on the process of transcribing ambient sound data to tactile cups, we wish to highlight how data tactility and data stories may play a central role in unraveling meaning from IoT data. Data tactility: In process, anticipated, and  lived The meaning of our dataset takes shape in the ways we  worked with the machine [5]. Experimenting with differ - ent nozzles, layer heights, clay humidity, and pause lengths, turned out to be an integral part to our creative and craft process . The meaning embedded in the tactility of the cups  was not only a result of the abstract data transcription from the excel sheets to the G-code through the 3D printer; in that sense, data tactility is contingent on the material, tools, and processes of making."

From a human - centred computing perspective, the end- user’s interpretation of  these visualisations is a critical challenge to design for, with empirical evidence already showing that ‘usable’ visualisations are not necessarily effective from a learning pe rspective. Since  an educator’s interpretation of visualised data is essentially the construction of a narrative  about student progress, we draw on  the growing body of work on Data Storytelling (DS) as the  inspiration for a set of enhancements that could be  applied to  data visualisations to improve their communicative power. We  present a pilot study that explores the effectiveness of these DS elements  based on educators’ responses to paper prototypes. The  dual purpose is understanding the contribution of eac h visual  element for data storytelling, and the effectiveness of the enhancements when combined.

ACM, New York, NY, USA , 10 pages.   https://doi.org/1 0.1145/3170358.3170380   1 INTRODUCTION   In recent years, educational dashboards and visualisations (which we will also refer to as “visual learning analytics” [5])  have gained considerable attention in the field of learning analytics (s ee recent reviews in [3, 24] ). Borrowing from big data  and web analytics in other domains, learning analytics  dashboard aggregates indica tors, from one or more sources,  about students’ activity and/or learning, using one or more visualisations [24, 28]."
A108,Driving Data Storytelling from Learning Design,1,1,data storytelling,"In brief, the contribution of this paper is a Learning Design driven data storytelling approach, providing the r ationale for combining  data  storytelling foundations and the teacher’s learning design, for  developing visual learning analytics interfaces. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2  discusses current visual learning analytics challenges reported in the literature, and presents the foundations of data storytelling. Section 3 describes the proposed Learning Design driven data storytelling approach and compares it with a typical data -driven  dashboard design approach. Section 4 describes an exploratory study with teachers , to illustrate the application of the model. The paper concludes in Section 5, with reflections on the feasibility of this work and further directions of data storytelling for learning analytics.   2 BACKGROUND   2.1 Related W ork   Although “learning dashboards” and other visual learning  analytics have been getting significant traction in recent years  [3, 24] , there have also been numerous reports pointing to the  limitations and possible pitfalls  of rolling out these products (e.g.  [4, 12, 20, 26] ). The design of effective dashboards in educational  contexts is complex. First, a recent review [3] pointed to the  absence of design choice justifications reported in several research outputs presenting educational dashboards usage. A  current review finds poor evidence of grounding in the learning sciences  [11]."
A108,Driving Data Storytelling from Learning Design,1,1,data storytelling,"Our approach is aimed at providing a way to address some of  the problems highlighted above by providing a Learning Design driven approach to bring Data Storytelling and general visual design principles into the design of visual learning analytics. To  the b est of our knowledge, no prior dashboards proposed in the  Learning Analytics literature use such an approach. The closest  work to ours has been conducted by Klerkx et. al [13] who  suggested general considerations regarding the design of visual and interaction properties of learning dashboards.   2.2 Foundations of Data Storytelling   Data Storyte lling (DS) can be described as an ""information  compres sion"" technique, to help an audience focus on what is  most important to communicate via data visualisation [23]. DS  builds on both classic Information Visualisation (InfoVis) guidelines [27] and narrative storytelling foundations (e.g. plots,  twists and calls to action [16]). In the following sub- sections, we  describe a set of data storytelling principles we have distilled from literat ure on data visualisation and narrative; and a set of  data storytelling visual elements that can be added to the design of visualisations and dashboards.    2.2.1 Data Storytelling Principles . Tufte [27] suggested that a  visualisation should incorporate ""graphical excellence"" , meaning  that it has ""to reveal data with clarity precision and effi ciency"" . In  the same way, Ryan [23] stated that the goal of using visuals is  ""to communicate a key message clearly and effectively"" ,  emphasising the context and meaning through visual enhancements (e.g. changes in size, colours, saturation). While visualisations ar e intended either to explore  or explain  insights,  DS is focused on the latter."
A108,Driving Data Storytelling from Learning Design,1,1,data storytelling,"Although it may sound simple, many learning data visualisations can be designed to invite students or teachers to  132 Driving Data Storytelling from Learning Design LAK’18, March 7—9, 2018, Sydney, NSW, Australia      explore the data without a clear goal in mind. This motivated our  Learning Design driven approach. DS drives the audience’s focus of attention. Visual and  narrative elements should be used to create meaning in the visualisation."
A108,Driving Data Storytelling from Learning Design,1,1,data storytelling,"The next sub -section describes some visual elements that can  be added or removed from the data visualisations in order to translate these DS high level principles into concret e actions.   2.2.2 Data Storytelling Visual Elements . In [14], Knaflic  describes how to improve graphs by adding or removing visual elements with  the aim of supporting DS principles. We explain  each of these DS elements with an example. Figure 1 (left)  presents the output of a visualisation tool (Google spread sheets)  that we used to plot a real dataset: road user deaths per year in Australia , with a 12-month  projection  (bitre.gov.au)."

A108,Driving Data Storytelling from Learning Design,1,1,data storytelling,"The goal is to  translate the  learning intentions of the educator into data storytelling elements that highlight particular aspects of the data. Figure 2  (right) shows three boxes aligned at the top as the foundations of  our Learning Design driven data storytelling approach. These are the teacher’s learning design, the learner’s data, and the data storytelling elements. Our model considers that a teacher’s  pedagogical intenti ons, explicitly or implicitly specified in the  learning design, can be translated into rules  which can be read  by a data processing system. Once student data has been  collected, these rules can be used to reveal interesting behaviours or indicators in stud ent activity to which we wish to draw the educator’s or learner’s attention (e.g. when a student has low performance in an activity because she could not complete a correct step, or when a certain performance threshold is reached). Variations  in data can, to some extent, be  detected automatically with no domain knowledge."
A108,Driving Data Storytelling from Learning Design,1,1,data storytelling,"In summary, whil e the data storytelling elements play a  critical role for emphasising or de -emphasising visual elements  of a dashboard, the learning design (materialised as rules) provide s the contextual information to decide which  patterns or  events should be foreground ed. This way, the proposed Learning  Design driven data storytelling approach aims to keep humans ‘in-the-loop’, not just as consumers of the learning analytics, but  also able to shape what is being shown in the interface.   4 ILLUSTRATIVE STUDY   This section presents an exploratory study that illustrates the  feasibility of our approach. The section is divided into three sub - sections that present the following: 1) a description of a  collaborative learning situation from where a dataset was captured and student -facing dash board s were used; 2) the design  rationale of hand -crafted DS -enhanced versions of the  dashboards ; and 3) a n evaluation  study with teachers , to  understand the role played by the data storytelling elements to support sensemaking.   4.1 The Learnin g Situation   Fifteen undergraduate students, ranging from 21 to 26 years old,  enrolled in an introductory Database Systems subject from a  University, were asked to use a multi -display interactive tool [7]  as part of their regular classes, to practice database design related concepts.

Table 1 lists how some rules  were used to encode each learning intention, focused on Participation (rules 1 and 2) and Performance (3 and 4) respectively. Rule 1:  if the teacher’s  intention is to know if the group is  participating equally or not, the rule will search for patterns in  the graph where this behaviour is explicit: if a student was dominating (i.e. Participation of one student is higher than the other two students) by x minutes (x being defined by the teacher), a visual indicator  could be generated on the  visualisation itself highlighting this behaviour (see if-then rule  in  Table 1, row 1) ."

A108,Driving Data Storytelling from Learning Design,1,1,data storytelling,"Teachers expressed that the  information in the VDS graph was presented more clearly than in the OV: “removing the green background, grids and big circles,  made easier to explore the information.”   Notably, other elements which in principle are important for  data storytelling [14] were lower ranked. These included for  example the highlighted data points and using a thicker line to highlight acti vity. For instance, teachers mentioned that data  points  are useful for showing only relevant information and  that the thicker line makes easier to focus the attention one the  information.

A110,Making Data-Driven Articles More Accessible: An Active Preference Learning Approach to Data Fact Personalization,1,1,data-driven news,"ABSTRACT  Data-driven news articles are widely used to communicate societal  phenomena with concrete evidence. These articles are often accom- panied by a visualization, helping readers to contextualize content. However, blind and low vision (BLV) individuals have limited ac- cess to visualizations, hindering a deep understanding of data. We  explore the possibility of dynamically generating data facts (texts  describing data patterns in a chart) for BLV individuals based on  their preferences to aid the reading of such articles."
A110,Making Data-Driven Articles More Accessible: An Active Preference Learning Approach to Data Fact Personalization,1,1,data-driven news,We build a system that ranks data facts based on a user’s prefer- ences given a data-driven news article. Our system uses high-level  factors and features to model the data fact space efectively derived  from prior work and our formative study. Our system uses a batch  active learning model to learn individual preferences. It updates a  user’s preferences based on several example-based pair-wise queries  answered by the user.

The visu- alizations surface patterns that the story describes, often accompa- nying annotations on the top of the visualizations, aiding readers to  contextualize data with the story and vice versa. A great number of  prior works explore how to design an efective narrative visualiza- tion (e.g., [12, 36, 49, 54, 63, 81]) and how to automatically generate  the annotation overlay on top of the visualizations (e.g., [28, 36, 45]). In the context of a data-driven document, identifying links between  the data and the corresponding text facilitates the development of  useful features [42, 45, 46]."

In our work,  we followed Calliope’s approach to generating data facts. We con- sidered their proposed approaches, in addition to factors that we  identifed from other prior work and the formative study, to rank  the data facts based on individual users’ preferences. Also, none of  the prior work ofers a solution tailored to BLV individuals where  some unique considerations should be applied, such as taking into  account whether the data is covered by the article or not.  2.3 Making visualization accessible via text  description  Recently, Marriott et al.

A112,Big data real-time storytelling with self-service visualization,1,1,data storytelling,"In an age where big data along with social, mobile and the cloud are all converging in new and exciting ways, data storytelling has become more essential than ever. Bigdata storytelling is a technique of delivering information resulting from multifaceted data analysis process in a way that allows the decision-makers to easily and quickly understand the context, understand its meaning and draw conclusions from it [ 6]. The vital step in constructing any storytelling is structuring easy-to-follow data stories which are the sequences of causally related events. Foremost, storytelling takes time to unfurl and the tempo matches the audience’s aptitude to follow. Next, it holds theaudience’s attention by encompassing attention-grabbing background, typeset, and intrigue. Finally, it leaves a eternal perception, either by stimulating the audience’s curiosity and making them want to study or observe more. 2 Preliminaries and Basic Concepts In this section, we present the deﬁnitions and basic concepts of big data real-time analysis, real-time self-service visualization, and real-time data storytelling. 2.1 Big Data Analysis in Real Time To perform real-time big data analysis, three major steps are required and is presented in Fig. 1.

INTRODUCTION Integrating narrative text with visual evidence is a fundamental aspect of various investigative reporting ﬁelds such as sports journalism and intelligence analysis. Sports journalists gener- ate stories about sporting events that typically generate tremen- dous amounts of data. These stories summarize the event and build support for their particular narrative (e.g. why a particu- lar team won or lost) using the data as evidence."
A116,Coupling Story to Visualization: Using Textual Analysis as a Bridge Between Data and Interpretation,1,1,narrative visualization,"RELATED WORK Narrative visualizations are data visualizations with embedded “stories” presenting particular perspectives using various em- bedding mechanisms[14]. Segel et al. [14] discuss the utility of textual “messaging”and how author-driven approaches typi- cally include heavy messaging while reader-driven approaches involve more interaction. Kosara and Mackinlay [9] and Lee et al. [11], on the other hand, adopt a view of storytelling in visualization as primarily consisting of communication sep- arate from exploratory analysis. This view matches the way journalists use various data sources including videos and notes to create compelling stories [9]."

We present our findings as a step toward  developing user-adaptive support, and provide suggestions  on how our results can be leveraged for creating a set of  meaningful interventions for future evaluation. Author Keywords  User study; Narrative visualization; Individual differences;  User characteristics; User-adaptation; Personalization. INTRODUCTION   As digital information continues to accumulate in our lives ,  information visualizations have become an increasingly  relevant tool for discovering trends and shaping stories  from this overabundance of data (e.g ., Infographics [26] ,  Timelines [6] ). However, visualizations are typically  designed and evaluated following a one size-fits-all  approach, meaning they do not take into account the  potential needs of individual users . There is mounting  evidence that user characteristics such as cognitive abilities,  personality traits, and learning abilities, can significantly  influence user experience during information visualization  tasks (e.g., [25,33,38,41])."

The purpose of this paper is to introduce StoryOGD, a proto- type designed to assist practitioners in developing storytelling (i.e., citizen-friendly) portals without the need for coding, thus clos- ing the aforementioned gaps. The prototype is created based on the requirements collected from an exploratory study of websites (https://rb.gy/oqeipl, https://rb.gy/gglgl7) that aggregated open datasets and presented them in a user-friendly manner, as well as the dashboard principles outlined in [1]."

General belief is that these techniques may enhance the viewer experience, thus appealing to a broad audience and enticing the viewer to consume the entire video. However, no study has formally assessed the effect of these techniques on data insight communi- cation and viewer engagement. In this paper, we first propose a scale-based questionnaire covering five factors of viewer engage- ment we identified from multiple application domains such as game design and marketing."

To this aim, we have composed a quick and easy-to-use scale-based ques- tionnaire covering five factors impacting viewer engagement in data videos: (1) affective involvement, (2) enjoyment, (3) aesthetics, (4) focused attention, and (5) cognitive involvement. Focusing on pictographic representations and animations to setup and create a visualization scene, we used our questionnaire and conducted a series of studies through the Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Our results suggest that, although both animation and pictographic representations can elicit viewer engagement, they do so through different facets of viewer engagement."

Their ability to appeal to mass audiences and communicate a wide range of data insights in a short period of time, has made them popular among data journalists and has at- tracted the attention of researchers in the field. Data videos have also been studied from the perspective of film narratives, a medium that bears significant similarity with data videos. Amini et al. [ 2] examined 50 data videos and teased apart the various dimensions of data videos with respect to narratives in film or cinematography."

We refer to this subset of animation tech- niques as setup animation.

We compiled a list of statements capturing poten- tially relevant attributes of viewer engagement and eliminated those that did not apply to data videos as they were focused on a specific context (e.g., Parasocial interaction in game design). We identi- fied 53 statements (available at datavideo-engmtscale.github.io), covering the five engagement attributes (Table 1).3.2 Refining Engagement Scale To further examine the appropriateness and utility of the resulting scale, we conducted a study using the 53 item questionnaire to compare each item’s ratings on the engagement scale. 3.2.1 Study Design."

Results suggest that daily data journalism stories generally feature two visualisations that are likely to be bar charts. The majority of these visualisations are not interactive whereas maps turnout to be the most interactive type of visualisation. Data journalists rely predominantly on pre-pro- cessed data drawn from domestic governmental bodies."

The study shows that data-driven articles have a strong focus on “political, societal and economic issues ”(20), while education, culture and sports are relatively underrepresented. In accord- ance with the Canadian analysis, maps are a common visualisation type, only topped bystatic charts. Furthermore, Reimer and Loosen pointed out that interactivity is limited to rather unsophisticated features (20)."

As there is still no universally accepted de ﬁnition of data jour- nalism that would specify the features of a data journalistic product, sampling data-drivenarticles proves dif ﬁcult. Most websites do not have speci ﬁc data journalism sections or even departments, adding to the academic discussion of data journalism being a genre, meth-odology or storytelling format. As implicated by Weinacht and Spiller ( 2014 ), data journal- ism is employed across all sections; at the same time, there is no unanimous de ﬁnition of what a data-driven story looks like, thus providing no indicator in this respect."

The samples of previous studies as well as of this analysis should be considered approximations to either of these categories. Results A First Approximation: Length, Authors, Topics, Visualisations Based on the results, the following formal characteristics of data-driven articles can be outlined.

A122,Classifying Data Journalism: A content analysis of daily data-driven stories,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"As I used Schulmeister ’s(2003) taxonomy of interactivity —higher levels of interac- tivity allow more manipulation by the user —maps appear to be the least paternalistic elements of data-driven storytelling. In addition, I assume that also sources can have paternalism effects. Every fourth visualisation explicitly indicates governmental bodies as the data source and every fourth story uses at least one governmental data source. Tandoc and Oh ’s(2017, 1009) results show that 30 per cent of The Guardian ’sb i gd a t a stories rely on governmental data."

A122,Classifying Data Journalism: A content analysis of daily data-driven stories,1,1,data stories,"By examining the struc- ture and story line of daily data stories, I assu me that roughly every fourth article cri- tically points out wrongdoings by holding respective antagonists such as companiesor politicians accountable. In order to determine fully the investigative nature of a journalistic product, one would need to ge t further insights into processes that are not evident on a text level: the role of journalists, whether they encountered resist- ance or whether there had been attempts to de ter authors from investigating, asses- sing the relevance of the subject matter a nd if there had been any consequences or repercussions due to the reporting; getting a comprehensive picture to determine aninvestigative story requires additional ﬁndings which cannot be drawn from a quan- titative study.16 FLORIAN STALPH Downloaded by [University of Florida] at 06:34 20 October 2017   Conclusions and Perspectives In his case study, Borges-Rey concludes that data journalism in the United Kingdom has largely diversi ﬁed into three forms of data journalism: (1) a daily, quick turnaround, generally visualised, brief form of data journalism; (2) an extensive, thoroughly researched, investigative form of data journalism; and (3) a light, editorialised, entertaining, often- humorous, gami ﬁed form of data journalism. (Borges-Rey 2016 ,9 ) These three streams provide suitable concepts for classifying data-driven articles. What this study adds are empirical results that allow elaboration of the frequency of appearance of these forms of data journalism. Whereas previous content analyses —primarily due to the composition of samples— convey the impression that data-driven stories are in-depth, long-form, oftentimes investigative and visually sophisticated projects, this research puts available results into perspective."

In order to understand the feasibility of this method and if the human generated story is consistent with the story generated by the data science pipelines, we present two experiments: a data story study with 3 financial experts, 4 Ph.D. students, and 20 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, which offers several data stories generated by humans; and a validation study involving 39 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers who conducted usability and understandability assessments for 9 high-quality data stories, written by humans and machine. We conduct a qualitative analysis of human-written data stories to determine what people consider when writing data stories and if the human generated story is consistent with the one generated by the data science pipeline. The experimental results show that readers comprehend machine- written data stories as well as they comprehend human-written data stories.

A123,Auto-Generating Textual Data Stories Using Data Science Pipelines,1,1,data storytelling,"Currently, data storytelling involves combining data science with informa- tion visualization. While information visualization is an excellent presentation medium, complementing visualizations with textual narratives is likely to be more effective. For example, Calliope is a system that can automatically generate visual data stories from spreadsheets, but there are some performance bottlenecks in its de- sign and implementation [ 4]. When data understanding is realized, people’s mental models are modified. A mental model is consid- ered to be a cognitive structure that forms the basis of reasoning, decision-making, and behavior [ 5]. The work reported in this paper hypothesizes that data stories expressed in plain English enable people to build effective mental models. There has been a body of prior work known as data-to-text, in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG), to automati- cally generate textual data stories [ 6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]. The two main contributions of these prior works are (1) a rule-based data-to-text pipeline architecture [ 13] and (2) a methodology to ac- quire the required rule-based knowledge. The data-to-text method- ology employs primarily a corpus-based knowledge engineering process; human-written data stories are aligned with their underly- ing datasets and rules that map data to text are manually extracted from such parallel data-to-text corpus. Applying this data-to-text methodology in practice is challenging because it involves a steep learning curve for developers, and it involves high manual costs associated with acquiring and maintaining all the required knowl- edge. More importantly, this methodology fails to take advantage of the recent developments in data science. Because a significant part of the data-to-text pipeline is devoted to extracting insights from data, data science should inform both the data-to-text pipeline as well as the data-to-text methodology."

To make the data stories relevant to the audience, persona types and associate ques- tions these personas ask of the underlying data were defined.

An example input dataset to our data story generator is shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 shows its corresponding data story. 2 A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTEGRATING DATA SCIENCE WITH DATA-TO-TEXT NLG The consensus data-to-text pipeline architecture is shown in Figure 2. The first two modules (signal analysis and data interpretation) in the architecture are responsible for computing information from data and the last two modules are responsible for linguistically ex- pressing this information. Since data science pipelines are designed to compute insightful information from data, the first part of the data-to-text pipeline should be replaced with data science pipelines to take advantage of the abundant data science tools and libraries of algorithms that are being developed in the data science community. Moreover, a consensus methodology emerged for carrying out data science and data-to-text methodology needs to be adapted to take advantage of the data science methodology."
A123,Auto-Generating Textual Data Stories Using Data Science Pipelines,1,1,data stories,"This reusability is the main advantage of the proposed new pipeline in comparison to the traditional pipeline which often involves bespoke modules with poor reusability. 2.2 Adapting the Data-to-Text Methodology Methodologically, data-to-text pipelines are designed using guid- ance from human-written data stories. A human written data story is made up of several sentences and paragraphs (discourse structure). Each of the sentences expresses a message, a unit of information. An analysis of all the sentences in a data story reveals the infor- mational content of a data story. The first part (signal analysis and data interpretation) of the traditional data-to-text pipeline is then designed to extract the required information from the input data. In practice, algorithms used for data analysis tend to be aligned with individual messages (units of information) in the data story making the development very complicated. On the other hand, data science methodology to insight discovery from data is driven by business questions which express informational needs of business users. Tak- ing this question-driven data science methodology into account we propose a new data-to-text methodology where data stories are modelled in terms of answers to business questions rather than linguistic units of sentences and paragraphs. This means, the new proposed data-to-text methodology makes business questions as the central concept driving the design of pipelines which allows the design of the data science part and the linguistic part of the pipeline to be decoupled. Since each of these parts is designed to provide answers to the same set of questions, the new methodol- ogy ensures consistency among all the modules of the pipeline. In addition, the new methodology has the advantage of deploying two Auto-generating Textual Data Stories Using Data Science Pipelines ACAI’21, December 22–24, 2021, Sanya, China Figure 2: (a)The Data-to-Text Pipeline [13]-(b) The Data Science Pipeline [5] (c). The Proposed Data-to-Text Pipeline Figure 3: Prototype Implementation different groups of developers, data scientists and natura language engineers. 3 A PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW DATA-TO-TEXT FRAMEWORK We first propose a prototype based on natural language generation, as Figure 3 shows, the data will be read by the automatic story generation system. We use Statsmodels as the encoder because it is a very comprehensive package for statistical and economic research when using python [ 14] [15], it will try to fit the data with a suitable model and calculate the corresponding important information, such as R-square and P-value. The analysis results will be received by JinJa2 templates, as the decoder of the system, in the document planning stage, it will plan the content and choose the outline based on the fitting model from Statsmodels, in microplan- ning stage, it will refer expression, choose suitable words based on the personas and other settings, then aggregate them together to convert specifications to a real textual data story.4 EVALUATION For solving the above problem, it is necessary to understand how the mental model exactly works. Figure 4 is a general cognitive pro- cess, when we comprehend the dataset analysis results, we will first extract important information, then build a mental model to create easy to understand stories based on our own knowledge and experi- ence, and finally judge whether to accept or dismiss the results [ 16]. However, as mentioned above, this is a long and energy-consuming process, and whether readers can understand the analysis results depends largely on readers’ knowledge/experience and the time available. Naturally, some studies have found people can understand the analysis results faster if they have a summary or story of the data be- cause a good data summary can represent the core idea of data and effectively convey the meaning of it [ 17], and stories are formed by specific facts supported by data through appropriate logical connections, which can clearly highlight and emphasize key infor- mation and avoid ambiguity [ 18]."

Figure 4: Sensemaking Processing Figure 5: Two Methods of Data Story Generation Processing the manual process to write the data story. Therefore, as Figure 5 shows, to accelerate this process and reduce the cost of learn- ing or reviewing the knowledge needed to understand the data, we propose a new framework for data-to-text NLG that aims to automatically generate data stories by computer to accelerate the construction of mental models, and design experiments to verify our main hypothesis - could data stories generated by computers be no different from data stories written by humans in helping people build mental models and understand data? In summary, we want to use computers to automatically generate data stories, it aims to help different personas quickly understand datasets since data stories could help people build mental models quickly. For the implementation of this method, we use a new framework that combines IML methods with traditional data-to-text pipelines. The experiments in next section will verify the feasible of the method. 5 DESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENT Figure 6 is an overview of the two experimental processes. Experi- ment 1 not only provides us with materials for human-generated data stories but also allows us to better analyze if the attributes of human-generated data stories are consistent with computer pipeline templates. Experiment 2 verifies whether computer-generated data stories could be the same as human-generated data stories in terms of ease of understanding.5.1 Experiment 1 This experiment invites 3 financial experts, 4 Ph.D. students, and 20 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to participate, the main method of Experiment 1 is questionnaire investigation. The purpose for the participants is to read an analysis result of a dataset and then answer three questions which will guide participants to write a data story that aims to help the persona quickly understand the key information of the dataset. To help participants write a good data story, we use words that are easier to be understood by most people instead of some profes- sional words, such as using ‘short report’ instead of ‘data story’, ‘main audience’ instead of ‘persona’. We also produce a guideline that consists of three questions that affect people’s decision-making. Generally, the questions are about whether the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables is strong, whether independent variables have statistical significance to dependent variables, and which independent variable is the most important. 5.2 Experiment 2 This experiment invites 39 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to participate, we build three computer pipeline templates to generate three data stories based on the same dataset and the same per- sona as Experiment 1 used, also select six high-quality data stories from Experiment 1, one from a Ph.D. student, two from Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, three from Experts. Then we let each participant randomly read one from the nine data stories and ask them to answer several questions. The first question for providing Auto-generating Textual Data Stories Using Data Science Pipelines ACAI’21, December 22–24, 2021, Sanya, China Figure 6: Experimental Process the data story number, then answer four questions to test if partici- pants can understand the key information of the dataset analysis result by just reading the data story without knowing the analysis results. The four questions are whether the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables is strong, which independent variables have statistical significance to dependent variables, which independent variable is the most important, and who you think is the main audience of this data story. This will verily if computer pipelines generated data stories could be as good as human-generated data stories. 6 RESULTS FROM THE EXPERIMENTS 6.1 Results from Experiment 1 After collecting the results from Experiment 1, we first screened the experimental results, removed the unqualified stories, then, we made statistics of each story length, and statistics on the number of words described each part. Also, we counted each word in all the stories, we exclude punctuation and common words such as ""it"", ""and"", ""I"", then listed the high-frequency words, to determine whether human-generated stories are consistent with data science pipelines, we also listed the high-frequency words of computer pipeline templates. Last but not the least, we found most people will write an introduction for the data story to briefly describe thepurpose of the story, but few of them will write a conclusion to summarize the main idea of the story. After comparison, we find data story attributes written by humans are highly consistent with machine-written data stories. 6.2 Results from Experiment 2 Answers from the participants of Experiment 2 have been analyzed to create the data, we classify the statistical results according to the author type as Table 2 shows. Obviously, the error rate of computer- generated stories is lower than the other two. However, whether there are significant differences between the data stories generated by different authors needs further verification in the following section. 6.3 Statistical Significance and Effect Size To verify could the data story generated by computers is no different from the data story written by humans, we ran the one-way Anova test and Tukey HSD to confirm whether the reader’s understanding errors are related to the author of the data story. The data we used is the experiment result we collected from Experiment 2, in short, the data is the detailed content of Table 2, recording which data story each participant read and whether their answer to each question is correct or not.

As we can see, for people misunderstanding the information of R-squared (Question 2), P-value (Question 3), and Important Score (Question 4), the one-way Anova test agree with the null hypothesis which is a data story generated by Experts, Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers, and Computer pipelines is no significant difference for readers to understand, however, for people misunder- standing the information of who is the main audience (Question 5) of that data story, the one-way Anova test shows that computerpipelines are no different from experts, but computer pipelines have significant differences from Amazon Mechanical Turk worker. Although, we have verified the null hypothesis by one-way Anova test. But further, we also need to verify the effect size be- tween the three groups.

Although several earlier studies too demon- strated this using rule-based data-to-text technology, the proposed work achieves this by following a new data-to-text framework that integrates recent advancements in data science and interpretable machine learning into data-to-text NLG both at the pipeline level as well as at the methodology level. Because the proposed pipeline de- sign is driven by business questions major portions of the pipeline could be reused in contexts where similar questions are answered. Moreover, the link between questions and pipelines is extended to include user personas which enable developers to modularize pipeline design to link users to questions, questions to pipelines that compute the required answers from input data."
A123,Auto-Generating Textual Data Stories Using Data Science Pipelines,1,1,data stories,"The experiments also provide evidence that Amazon Mechanical Turk workers could write good quality data stories. Although the current work uses these human-written data stories as part of experiments, they could also be used to train neural NLG models.8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper presents a new framework for data-to-text NLG that takes advantage of the recent developments in data science both at the pipeline level as well as at the methodology level. Our evalu- ation experiments involving a prototype developed following the new framework show that users comprehend machine-written data stories as well as they comprehend human-written data stories. Because the pipelines, following the new framework, are designed under the guidance of user personas and their questions, the new framework improves the reusability of pipelines. Our future work will focus on strengthening the framework further by experiment- ing with a broad range of business questions seeking answers from larger datasets using a rich set of data science pipelines. We aim to run more experiments to confirm the equivalence of machine- written and human-written data stories. In addition, we intend to collect experimental evidence for improved reusability of data science modules across disparate data-to-text applications. REFERENCES [1]Manyika, M. G."

In this paper, we identify the key settings of ﬁnancial news: reasons for Economic index changes and impacts on/from it. To address these settings we classify each news article into three attributes: positive news (news about index increase), negative news (news about index decrease) and impact news (news about impacts on/from index change)."

For data  gathering, we used the affordances of mobile media to combine two time-honored traditions in the media: the man- on-the street interview and the public opinion survey. To do  this, we used mobile phones to  create a novel survey format  that tightly couples  closed-ended questions with the ability  to record video explanations of choices made. The result is a new type of content that we  call “storied numbers,” which  become “storied data” when aggregated, lending itself to  presentation using information visualization techniques."

A129,Storied Numbers: Supporting Media-Rich Data Storytelling for Television,1,1,data storytelling,"Show Time  Given the participants’ high level of expertise, it perhaps is not surprising that the key finding of the study can be  summed up as “it depends.” While there were concrete  suggestions for improving the scatterplot visualization to support performance, th ere was less agreement on  generalizing how data storytelling might play out in terms of potential program flow, how much storytelling action occurred either behind the scenes or in front of the camera,  and the optimal balance of interaction between touch or  tangible controls. These decisions, our professionals told us,  depend on the type of show being produced and the  strengths and preferences of individual performers. Learning Curve  All participants noted that th ere would be a learning curve  to using the interactive table, when first using the equipment and before each show, whether there was to be a  short segment as a sidebar, or  if the program featured the  table. One participant summed this up by saying “it’s a  trained motor skill” overall."
A129,Storied Numbers: Supporting Media-Rich Data Storytelling for Television,1,1,data storytelling,"Several participants pointed out that a talent’s knowledge of  the domain from which the data was generated would have  a great effect on how much support the talent might desire  for data storytelling. The political analyst John King of CNN, who pioneered the use of touch surfaces on U.S.  television, was cited as an example of someone who “you  really think you can go to for real information” due to his  relative ease with using touch surface technology and his command of relevant facts without scripting. Typically, some improvising in television performance is  desired, as it increases the liveliness of the program. The  dynamic nature of the data visualization was considered a  plus in this regard."

The data must be made  visual and plotted. Thus data storytelling should be facilitated  at all stages of production: content generation, content visualization/editorial, and performance. To this end, our system for supporting data storytelling combined an  experimental mobile survey data gathering application with  the creation of information visualizations for interactive tabletop presentation for television. Our evaluation with  television professionals validated our production model, but  raised important issues about the variability of production environments and on-air talent preferences in terms of  program control, visibility of action, and the use of our  interactive table. Next steps include refining the production model and technologies and creating pilot programs featuring  the use of our studio tabletop for storytelling and audience  testing of programs.

A130,Mediating Open Data Consumption - Identifying Story Patterns for Linked Open Statistical Data,1,1,data story,"Lately, ideas for extending open data platform with data story  features have been considered.

To enable the generation of insights from  data published on open data platforms, tools for data analysis and  visualisations are required. Recent studies such as [26] also show that both small and large  newsrooms are employing data story telling using publicly  available data including open data in their data journalism  practices.

Such approach allow integrating data from different  sources into one big network of related records."
A130,Mediating Open Data Consumption - Identifying Story Patterns for Linked Open Statistical Data,1,1,data stories,"USING DATASTORY PATTERNS IN LOSD  ANALYSIS  According to[26], data stories are artefacts for revealing and  communicating insights gained from the analysis of data-sets  obtained from the public domain, crowdsourcing or big data  sources. From the same source and [17], data storytelling is a  structured approach comprising elements including data, visuals  and narratives for communicating insights obtained from data. Data stories could help to inform, explain, persuade or engage the  target audience.  4.1. Linked Data Story Patterns  In our investigation about patterns in data storytelling, which  could be applicable in exploring and analysing LOSD, a number of  patterns were identified. We describe these patterns below  grouped by their sources in literature. Authors of [14] defined three types of data stories:   Hero Stories are used to show that there is a solution to  an existing problem. e “Hero” is the data and  technology, which can solve the identiﬁed problem. e  ﬁrst key point of this type of story is to show the  audience what is the actual problem. When the reader is  aware of the problem, the eﬀect of the “hero” (a speciﬁc  solution or silver bullet) is then presented. An example  of the problem or societal challenge could be climate  change.   Learning Stories involves making the audience aware of  an existing problem. However, compared with Hero  Stories, the presented crisis will not get solved by a  “hero” but through participation.   Horror Stories are used to exaggerate a societal or public  problem for urgency."
A130,Mediating Open Data Consumption - Identifying Story Patterns for Linked Open Statistical Data,1,1,data stories,"Researchers in this paper [27] are using data stories as:   Instructional Tool – this story type is aimed at creating  stories as instructions to prevent bad decision/actions in  the future. Information hidden in the data can show  what mistakes were made in the past and by making  stories authors show wider audience that there was a  problem in the past and this is how you should avoid it.  is could be in the choice of a speciﬁc policy choice in a  particular context.   Intervention – is story type aims to show the scale of a  particular problem in the society, for instance a public  health issue or disaster as a tool to convince vulnerable  communities. Such stories encourage citizens to realise  how big the problem is and that there is no ready  solution to it. is paern can be place between Learning  and Horror Stories. In [31], the authors discuss three general types of data stories:   Martini Glass Structure – this story type starts from  narrow author’s narrative and later expands to allow  reader to freely explore the data. Storyteller can only  suggest which path is the best one.   Interactive Slideshow - divide story in slides with  author’s narrative. Reader can move to another part  (slide) of the story when he decides. is type is  optimum for big sets of data or complex stories in order  to avoid user geing lost.   In Drill Down Story author declares possible interactions  between user and the data. User, as in interactive  slideshow, decides the pace of storytelling."
A130,Mediating Open Data Consumption - Identifying Story Patterns for Linked Open Statistical Data,1,1,data stories,"Porwol     Reader Driven – this way of telling data stories enables  interaction with the user. e user is able to relate  emerging paerns in the interface to speciﬁc events. Audience is allowed to move freely around story and  author can only point the suggested way of interpreting  the data.   Hybrid experience is a combination of two story paerns  mentioned earlier. e author leads reader more than in  Reader driven approach but reader has still some  freedom to explore data himself. There are two clear categories of story patterns from the reviewed  literature above. The first set of data story patterns in [14] & [27]  are named to reveal the nature or essence of the story. The  nomenclature of second set of patterns in [31] & [2] are such that  they reveal the nature of interactions afforded by the stories. They  also suggest what the end-users can do with the data story artefact  (visualisation or interactive table). In [26], a typology of data story  telling patterns was described by the authors. The typology  identified two categories of data story patterns including those  characterised by on the nature of the data stories and the other  based on the nature of analysis to be accomplished.   4.2. Categorization of discovered patterns  The patterns defined in 4.1 are somewhat high-level. Authors of  [26] created typology, based on [10] and [11] which are used for  the exploring LOSD. The Table below present some of the  applicable “analytical” story patterns in Linked Data approach and  gives an example or real-life condition applicable to this pattern."

A132,Tension as an enabling characteristic of innovating in schools,1,1,data stories,Findings – Four data stories describe multiple patterns of innovating activity that cannot accurately be accounted for in terms of a general notion of resistance. The idea that tension enables innovationpractice is proposed. Research limitations/implications – Approaches to school innovation that assume difference should be smoothed out or there is a risk of obstructing its practical accomplishment. Practical implications – This paper provides a case for school leaders to expect and cultivate conditions that enable innovative tension and the co-presence of multiple patterns of innovatingactivity.
A132,Tension as an enabling characteristic of innovating in schools,1,1,data stories,"Extracts from data stories (Lather, 1991) describingthe actual innovating experiences of four schools are reported. John Law’s (1997) idea that new ways of knowing practice include those that keep difference in tension (rather than seeking to reconcile or eliminate it) is used to describe the character of theseexperiences. “Innovative tension” is proposed as a condition that enables innovation practice in schools. Re-orienting research The idea of school innovation as elusive and problematic is not new. Typically beingconﬁned to a pre-determined unit of analysis, studies have investigated associations between innovation and individual attributes (cognition, perception and personality), group, organisational, social and cultural attributes."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"Original Research Article Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories Jennifer Gabrys1, Helen Pritchard1and Benjamin Barratt2 Abstract Citizen sensing, or the use of low-cost and accessible digital technologies to monitor environments, has contributed to new types of environmental data and data practices. Through a discussion of participatory research into air pollutionsensing with residents of northeastern Pennsylvania concerned about the effects of hydraulic fracturing, we examine hownew technologies for generating environmental data also give rise to new problems for analysing and making sense ofcitizen-gathered data. After first outlining the citizen data practices we collaboratively developed with residents formonitoring air quality, we then describe the data stories that we created along with citizens as a method and techniquefor composing data. We further mobilise the concept of ‘just good enough data’ to discuss the ways in which citizen datagives rise to alternative ways of creating, valuing and interpreting datasets. We specifically consider how environmental data raises different concerns and possibilities in relation to Big Data, which can be distinct from security or social media studies. We then suggest ways in which citizen datasets could generate different practices and interpretive insights thatgo beyond the usual uses of environmental data for regulation, compliance and modelling to generate expanded datacitizenships."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"Keywords Citizen sensing, citizen data, environmental data, data practices, data stories, data citizenships From Fitbit to the Air Quality Egg, there are an increasing number of devices and practices now avail-able for generating data. Whether monitoring a pulse or capturing the daily patterns of air pollution, users are able to measure, track and analyse environmentsand health. Yet despite the proliferation of these tech-nologies, the practices and objectives for collecting dataare diverse and are oriented toward diﬀerent monitor-ing objectives. In this paper, we consider how the rise ofcitizen sensing, or the use of low-cost and accessibledigital technologies to monitor environments, has con- tributed to new types of environmental data and data practices."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"Such just good enough citizen data could also contribute to diﬀerent data practices and data stories to generate more openand democratic engagements with environmental dataand environmental problems (cf. Corburn, 2005;Gabrys, 2016a). It is these practices that we see as con-stitutive of data citizenships, not as a designation ofmembership (such as to a nation state), but rather asdata-related engagements that activate political subjects and collectives in relation to environmental problems (cf. Gabrys, 2016b)."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"Together with par-ticipants, we then created data stories to establish amethod and technique for composing the multiplemodes of citizen data. We consider how the data stories, which include data visualisations and analysis produced from our ‘Airsift’ data toolkit, provide diﬀerent ways of parsing and operationalizing citizen data. We also discuss processesfor drawing out patterns about possible air pollutionsources from the citizen data. We approach these pat-terns as storying processes that contribute to collectivemodes of making sense of and developing responses toenvironmental data, and for inventing alternative waysof generating, valuing and interpreting datasets. These data stories drew on multiple forms of data and were written through the input of multiple actors and enti-ties, including researchers and residents, policymakersand regulators, as well as sensors and algorithms. As amethod and technique, the data stories seek to situateenvironmental sensor data in its lived material condi-tions. The data stories present a way to account morefully for the stories we already tell with data, across the range citizen or scientist engagements, while also enga- ging with storying as an inventive practice. From democratization of sensing to democratization of data Many citizen sensing projects often express their com- mitment to undertaking the democratization of envir- onmental monitoring through the development of2 Big Data & Society low-cost and low-tech devices. We use the term ‘citizen sensing’ here as a way to distinguish these monitoringpractices in relation to a long-standing set of citizenscience practices. In its original use, citizen sensingreferred to volunteered geographic information(Goodchild, 2007)."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"From data practices to data stories Turning now to discuss the citizen-gathered air qualitydata and data stories in more detail, we work throughthe ways in which we found types of data and datapractices to be co-constitutive. We also demonstratehow citizen data required multiple diﬀerent encountersand ways of making sense of collective datasets and observations as they were emerging and had already been documented. Indeed, we initially came to workwith this community because residents were alreadyengaged in environmental and air quality monitoring,whether through self-initiated projects, environmentaljustice campaigns or sample collection for university-based scientists. The ﬁrst part of our research focusedon learning more about these existing monitoring tech- niques and the data gathered."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"We describe these practice-based andparticipatory methods in relation to the monitoringprocess, data practices and data stories, as our focus here is also speciﬁcally on the issues that arose in rela- tion to citizen data. Developing a data stories method Stories, as Bell (2015: 19) suggests in her discussion ofBig Data, are a way of generating and accounting forresponsibilities that might emerge in relation to data. In this sense, we understand data stories as we developthem here to be more than a visual or even narrative technique, as they articulate forms of relevance andresponsibility that might be activated through data.In composing these stories, we also draw on Haraway(1997) who suggests that stories are not only integral tothe politics of composing technoscience, but are also a technique for making worlds. In other words, ‘to ‘‘ﬁgure’’ means to count or calculate and also to be ina story, to have a role’ (Haraway, 1997: 11).Figurations, from this perspective, include languageand mathematics, the verbal and the visual: they crossthe boundaries of the qualitative and the quantitative,which in themselves are ﬁgurations of data. Theyalso ‘can be condensed maps of contestable worlds’ (Haraway, 1997), and thereby capture and express the diﬀerent worlds that are at stake in theseﬁgurations. In composing these data stories, we developed a dis- tributed ‘authoring’ process, where citizen data andobservations, text and images, assemble along withvisualizations and analyses, generated through digitalsensors and computational algorithms, human senses and more-than-human detection techniques, which were also worked and reworked by researchers and resi-dents, designers and programmers. Drawing onHaraway, we develop these data stories as modes of‘interpretive practice’ that ‘map universes of know-ledge, practice and power’ (Haraway, 1997). Working in northeastern Pennsylvania, we collect- ively identiﬁed air pollutants to monitor based on resi- dents’ expressed concern about speciﬁc emissions and sources, as well as in relation to available low-cost tech-nology. The citizen sensing kits that participants usedto monitor air quality in northeastern Pennsylvaniaconsisted of an analogue badge for monitoring ben-zene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (or BTEX,which are hazardous chemicals associated with petrol-eum industries), a digital ‘Speck’ device for ‘real-time’ monitoring of particulate matter (or PM 2.5which are small particles from carbon to pollen, and which are acriteria air pollutant of particular concern for cardiac,pulmonary and respiratory disease), a logbook and anonline platform for mapping, viewing and downloadingdata. These kits were distributed to 30 participants,who monitored consistently and/or sporadically overa seven-month period."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"However, the forms of data that assembled into data stories did not in all casesexist as standardised units of measure, but alsoincluded experiences, observations and accounts thatwe collectively gathered as part of the composing pro-cess for developing data stories. Once we had distributed the monitoring kit to resi- dents and as the citizen monitoring unfolded over thespace of several months, an increasing sense of urgencyemerged not just to undertake air quality monitoringbut also to analyse the data. Residents lived with theday-to-day visceral experience and abject response to anumber of industry activities underway, from the ‘stink’of infrastructure to the constant truck traﬃc and the din of compressor stations. They were concerned about their health, and about the impact of this industry onthe community."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"In the process of estab-lishing techniques for making sense of the citizen-gath-ered data, we generated ﬁve data stories in ﬁve diﬀerenttownships that we developed as a method for makingsense of the data (Figures 1 to 5). We used townships asthe location identiﬁer for the stories so as to blur the exact monitoring locations while still maintaining a clear relation to infrastructure and sites of possiblepollutants.The data included in the data stories was complex and multi-faceted, coming from a variety of sourcesand practices. Using our ‘Airsift’ data analysis toolkit,we generated visualizations that indicated time of daywhen pollution might be occurring, as well as location,emission source, and relationship to temperature, humidity and wind speed and direction. We worked with residents to gather observations and to compare‘data’ to ‘data’, or in other words, to assess how numer-ical data aligned (or not) with experience on theground, for instance, of industry operations or experi-ences of emissions. We also identiﬁed points wherewhat would ordinarily be overlooked as not data-worthy or as incalculable could be included in the inter- pretive practices of the data stories. Data stories can present a way to encounter the points where databecomes seemingly intractable. It is at these pointswhere new data practices and data stories could alsoemerge. Using the data stories as a method and technique, we then developed these as forms of evidence that could be‘just good enough’ to suggest that more attention should be given to ensuring air quality is protected in relation to fracking activities. In the three sections thatfollow, we discuss the ﬁve data stories in more detail,including the types of data and data practices engagedwith, as well as the ways in which citizen data expandedunderstandings of and approaches to the problem of airpollution through developing new forms of evidence.We discuss the process of forming these stories, and include some of the content that contributed to these ﬁgurations.

His home has become increasingly enclosed by fracking infrastructure, so that he is now living within what he calls a ‘death triangle’, where three compressorstations surround his home. The sound and smells fromthe stations are felt most acutely at night, where noisethat Paul likens to the sound of an airport permeatesthe walls of his house. No matter which way the windblows, Paul receives emissions from this nearby infra-structure – and compressor stations have been described by some residents as similar to reﬁneries in the intensity of their operation."

We then compared emissions inventories and temporal patterns with the particulate data as visualized through our‘Airsift’ data toolkit, analysing spikes and peak eventsin the datasets, homing in to understand the temporaland spatial distribution of the pollution events, andattempting to piece together the likely causes of localpollution events. Through this process of contextualising the measure- ment data in relation to observations and events, cer- tain patterns settled into forms of evidence through theuse of multiple data types, which further indicated linksbetween pollution events and industry sources. Wefound at the Bridgewater site (Figure 1) that a nearbycompressor station was likely causing signiﬁcant pollu-tion events, even though there was also a fracking sitedirectly across the road less than 500 feet from the monitoring site."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"Data stories: Finding patterns, attributing sources Although the citizen data did not assemble into a com-plete or continuous dataset, by working across diﬀerenttypes of data that could be compared and cross refer- enced, we could begin to detect patterns and tell storiesabout the data. While our ‘Airsift’ toolkit processed the citizen-gathered data to produce charts and plots ofpollution patterns, we also began to cross-referencethe visualizations and to piece together evidential stor-ies that could describe whether and when pollutionevents might be occurring. This process required establishing the regional base- line, or average pollution level, that might be expectedas part of the background or regional pollution for thisarea. Based on the overall community datasets, weestablished that the regional particulate baseline wasaround 15 mgm /C03."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"Data stories: Activating data as relevant Working through these just good enough forms of data,we found that it was possible to establish patterns ofevidence from which claims could be made about local sources of air pollution. The citizen-gathered data is unique in that it not only provides air quality data ina region where there is relative absence of monitoring,but also because it is spatially dense and occurs over alonger monitoring period than most episodic ‘expert’monitoring. This allowed neighbouring data to be com-pared, and sensor data could be corroborated and aug-mented with observations. Rather than seeking to match the regulatory practices of monitoring in order to arrive at precise measurements of air pollutant levels,the citizen-gathered data indicated whether pollutionevents might be occurring and how they might be iden-tiﬁed."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"These diﬀerent forms of citizen data and datapractices are intertwined and co-constitutive, but theyalso point to the ways in which data might be furtheractivated to arrive at points of relevance and action- ability through the data stories that capture multiple experiences of pollution. But these ways of activating data are also deeply entangled with the ways in which stories about dataare told. Two residents, Meryl and Rebecca, whowere somewhat anxious to begin analysing the databeing gathered and to determine whether any clear pat-terns were emerging, began their own process of exam- ining the particulate data by developing spreadsheets showing elevated levels of pollutants as well as the fre-quency of these events. Using this analysis, Meryl andRebecca then contacted a number of state and federalenvironmental and health regulators."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"In thiscontext, citizens should arguably receive greater recog- nition for the ways in which they have developed their own data practices and data stories that not only pro-vide unique insights across diﬀerent forms of data, butalso draw attention to the limitations of ‘oﬃcial’ regu-latory practices and the possible contributions to bemade by citizen data and data practices. While residents were not following a regulatory pro- cess for undertaking environmental monitoring, they argued that their data was still relevant as it provided often clear and consistent patterns indicating that pollu-tion events were occurring. As they further argued, theirdata was unique in the perspectives it oﬀered and theways in which it matched up diﬀerent forms of datathat might not ordinarily be cross-referenced. This dif-ferent approach to environmental data and evidencethen activated diﬀerent types of data relations."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"In other words, the data stories were developingnew interpretive practices that could operationalize dataso as to take account of lived experiences, yet throughdistinctly non-linear and entangled engagements(cf. Garnett, 2016). The data stories are not necessarilya way of revealing results. Instead, as a process of‘ﬁguring’ data stories generate other worlds and world- ing processes from citizen data, in which citizens’ experi- ences matter. Conclusion: Just good enough data and creative data citizenships Citizen sensing practices are inventive and diverse, mobilising many diﬀerent devices, protocols and infra- structures. Although much environmental monitoring takes place in organised structures and projects, ourresearch has shown that ‘informal’ sensing practicesare an important aspect of sensing and data infrastruc-tures (Gabrys and Pritchard, forthcoming). A crucialpart of these practices is the generation of new andalternative types of data and data stories that emergealong with citizen monitoring practices. This citizen- gathered data is often ‘just good enough’ to establish patterns of evidence that can mobilise communityresponses in terms of communicating with regulators,requesting follow-up monitoring, making the case forimproved regulation and industry accountability, andkeeping track of exposures both on an individual andcollective level. Despite the fact that many experts refer to regula- tory standards as the primary if not only way in which to undertake monitoring, we suggest that if citizenswere to proceed with the use of technologies and proto-cols that simply follow regulators’ practices they couldshut down the very possibilities that citizen monitoringmight have the potential to open up. By merely follow-ing regulatory practices, numerous citizens would beexcluded from undertaking monitoring, or from enga- ging with data practices and generating forms of evi- dence that resonate with their experiences."
A133,Just good enough data: Figuring data citizenships through air pollution sensing and data stories,1,1,data stories,"While the data stories we have discussedhere suggest one method and technique for workingthrough citizen data, we would hope there are multiple ways in which citizen sensing and citizen data might be approached that could expand the space for whatcounts as actionable data (cf. Schrock, 2016), whileopening up new types of data practices toward invent-ive data citizenships. Citizen-generated data and data analysis can oﬀer alternative ways of thinking about the often-monolithicdiscourses around environmental data and Big Data to develop an understanding of the concrete ways in which data practices unfold in relation to environmentalproblems. They potentially help to generate a set oftechniques for engaging with and querying evidenceand evidence making; while providing an opening intowhat Gray et al. (2016) refer to as a challenge to theusual ways of collecting and interpreting data."

A135,Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Profit Organizations,1,1,storytelling with data,"Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Proﬁt Organizations Sheena Erete†, Emily Ryou†, Geoff Smith*, Khristina Fassett*, Sarah Duda* †College of Computing and Digital Media *Institute for Housing Studies DePaul University Chicago, IL USA serete@cdm.depaul.edu, emily.ryou@gmail.com, [gsmith33, kfassett, sduda1]@depaul.edu ABSTRACT Despite the growing promotion of the “open data"" movement, the collection, cleaning, management, interpretation, and dis- semination of open data is laborious and cost intensive, partic- ularly for non-proﬁts with limited resources. In this paper, we describe how non-proﬁt organizations (NPOs) use open data, building on prior literature that focuses on understanding chal- lenges that NPOs face. Based on 15 interviews of staff from 10 NPOs, our results suggest that NPOs use data to develop narratives to build a case for support from grantors and other stakeholders. We then present empirical results based on the usage of a data portal we created, which suggests that tech- nologies should be designed to not only make data accessible, but also to facilitate communication and support relationships between expert data analysts and NPOs."
A135,Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Profit Organizations,1,1,storytelling with data,"Storytelling with Data NPOs primarily use data to narrate local conditions to seek support for their goals. Data provides “ways for information to come alive"" (C1) and establishes evidence for future strate- gic planning. NPOs use storytelling to make data consumable for their target audience, which can include internal and ex- ternal stakeholders, government ofﬁcials, funders, ﬁnancial investors, residents, and community leaders. Using Boje’sstudy of organizations using storytelling, we deﬁne to story- telling as “how people [or organizations] perform stories to make sense of events, introduce change, and gain political ad- vantage"" [7]."
A135,Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Profit Organizations,1,1,data stories,"The remainder of this section describes two types of stories that NPOs tell: het- erogeneous andhomogeneous data stories. We conclude by describing how NPOs incorporate context to strengthen their stories. Heterogeneous Data Stories Heterogeneous data stories amalgamate multiple data to tell one composite story that depicts current conditions of a spe- ciﬁc area. R6, a director at a region-based organization, de- scribes an example: “When we talk about telling our story, I think we also use broader economic data, both population changes, not only in the city and the suburbs, but within speciﬁc com- munity areas, racial, ethnic change within a particular area, income information, unemployment information."" Heterogeneous data stories often try to answer questions such as, “How has our organization affected foreclosure rates in our targeted neighborhood?"" or “What policy changes will affect development?"" NPOs tell heterogeneous data stories by compiling complex data. These are custom built data, derived from multiple sources and datasets (such as housing, crime, demographics, etc.) and can span across large geographies and time frames. We found that in-house data analysts rarely com- pile these complex data; instead, NPOs rely on relationships with external data analysts (such as our FEDAs) to obtain and interpret these datasets. To tell heterogeneous data stories, NPOs often need to un- dergo a complicated process to identify the data needs. NPOs without a data analyst rely on relationships with FEDAs for this process. In-house data analysts, such as R2, use their own unique, complicated analysis process to identify key data components: 1277CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA “This department was just trying to get an aerial snap- shot of what’s happening there. “What"" and “what"" kinds of issues are overlapping with each other? The way I went about that wasn’t exactly to ﬁgure out [the] research question, but to compartmentalize issues that I thought went together."" Homogeneous Data Stories Homogeneous data stories consist of one dataset that can tell multiple stories. NPOs may manipulate one speciﬁc dataset to tell various stories. Our analysis suggests two types of homogenous data stories: parcel and trend based. NPOs tell parcel-based homogeneous data stories using parcel level data – that is, information about individual units or build- ings. Often, these stories try to answer questions such as “Is this unit vacant?"" The purpose of these stories is to help iden- tify the status of speciﬁc units or buildings to, ultimately, aid in administering and identifying new program opportunities (e.g. foreclosure prevention). Parcel-level questions could also be applied to other topics; in health, for example, a parcel-level question may translate into a question about whether a house- hold has been exposed to a particular disease. In other words, parcel-level questions are very low-level questions that may be important for “on-the-ground"" program implementation."
A135,Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Profit Organizations,1,1,data stories,"Parcel-based homogeneous data stories pertain to small geo- graphic areas (sometimes as small as one square mile), over short time periods – such as weeks. C7, from a community- based organization, describes an example of using parcel level data to tell a homogeneous data story: “We track losses of Single Room Occupancies because when we go to alderman, we want to say, ’Look, this is happening really fast, and we need an ordinance to pre- vent this bleeding from continuing in our neighborhoods. ’ And that’s a really stark number that people respond to."" Packaged datasets (e.g., existing data cleaned and ready for use) may not exist to tell this type of parcel-based story, leav- ing NPOs to manually obtain this data through ﬁeldwork (e.g., physically visiting buildings and documenting the conditions), calling landlords or tenants, or performing Internet searches. These homogeneous data stories require very detailed data, which most open datasets do not provide. Trend-based homogeneous data stories use aggregated datasets to help NPOs understand patterns and trends that communicate changes in neighborhood market conditions over a designated period of time – retrospectively and prospectively. These types of homogeneous data stories may answer questions such as, “In the past year, have foreclosures increased or decreased in this neighborhood?"" This data relates to larger geographical areas (e.g., neighborhoods, municipalities) and over annual time periods. These stories help measure and narrate organizational progress, create benchmarks, and/or programmatic goals and evalua- tions. For example, C3’s organization tells a story about their progress in reducing racially segregated housing by “look[ing] at the change from this census to that census [to see if] the integration of [this community] has improved.""Data Context to Strengthen Stories NPOs use data to describe a speciﬁc context to forge a stronger connection with their targeted audience. Adding context to narratives can be achieved via geographical or statistical data."
A135,Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Profit Organizations,1,1,data stories,"NPOs require varying levels of geocoded data to accurately compare matching data to produce neigh- borhood trajectories, comparisons, and heterogeneous and homogeneous data stories. Unavailable geocoded data affects the story being told. NPOs compromise by using related, available data and then modify their message accordingly. R5 recounts: “If it’s not at the level we want it, we have to help inter- pret it or come up with a way of talking about it that is useful in our geography. [..] It’s almost like crafting your message."" Accessing raw data can be challenging for NPOs."
A135,Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Profit Organizations,1,1,data stories,"FEDAs collaborate with NPOs throughout the use of open data through personalized services (which include personal consultations), technical support, cultivating in-ﬁeld awareness, and custom datasets to craft heterogeneous data stories. Relationships with FEDAs bridge the gap between NPOs’ lim- ited resources [15, 29, 31, 30, 32] and their technical data skills [9] by providing a means of collaborative analysis. We deﬁne collaborative analysis as the symbiotic relationship between NPOs and FEDAs, where FEDAs typically provide technical support (e.g., detailed analysis, context for data) while NPOs provide insight given their local knowledge that allows for a more sophisticated, informed interpretation of results that ex- tends beyond simple quantitative analysis. During one-on-one consultations, NPOs brief FEDAs on their goals."

CONCLUSION This paper moves HCI designers and researchers beyond creat- ing open data tools that are simply clearinghouses, databases, or storage facilities where NPOs with limited resources are forced to scour through massive amounts of data.

ABSTRACT We describe the design of Story Builder, a tool to support adoles- cents in building interactive multimedia stories that integrate data analysis and visualization with text, images, and other multimodal resources. Story Builder is a plug in for the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP), a free, online, open-source drag-and- drop interactive data analysis system. Based on early prototyping conducted with several 7th grade classrooms, we sought to design a tool that would allow students to (a) integrate their data investiga- tions with relevant personal and contextual information; (b) record the step-by-step process and rationale of their data analysis; and (c) reflect on and share these contextual and process-oriented elements Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page."

One practice that is increasingly common in the professional world, and is generating enthusiasm from educators, is data storytelling [19]. In data sto- rytelling, the presentation of data and statistics are coupled with other visual and narrative elements to explain what is done to data during the process of analysis, why such analysis is important, and to communicate to a broad audience the results and implications of said analysis. TheWriting Data Stories project (NSF IIS-1900606) seeks to intro- duce students to data storytelling by encouraging them to articulate their personal and social connections to data as they simultaneously engage with the statistical patterns contained therein. In doing so, our project recognizes that a great deal of conceptual and personal work goes into students’ initial preparation and exploration of data. For example, students may seek a grounding in the data by filtering and searching a dataset to find specific records that represent them- selves or other familiar information [ 18,21]. Or, they might want to reduce the complexity of their initial investigation by focusing on only a few key attributes of a large dataset, expanding their investi- gation later [ 7]."
A138,Reflective Data Storytelling for Youth: The CODAP Story Builder,1,1,data stories,"We have been developing and testing the Story Builder tool to support stu- dent investigations related to socioscientific topics including health, climate, and local ecosystems. 2 THEORY AND RELATED WORK The Writing Data Stories project, and the design of Story Builder specifically, are inspired by literature in both science and statistics education that emphasize the need to introduce students to data as evidentiary texts. The science education literature, for instance, has demonstrated that it is important for students to understand how data can be made useful for the needs that arise in their own course of investigation, rather than for a predetermined goal [ 16]. While much research has explored how this can be done by having stu- dents collect their own data, less has explored how students might approach large, pre-existing datasets as resources that they can re-construct and re-represent for purposes of analysis. However, working with such large existing datasets is central to science prac- tice [ 5]."

If a dataset includes geographic information, students can also create maps and drag-and-drop attributes to colorize the map accordingly. When one or more records in a dataset are selected, the corresponding visual representations of that record are also highlighted to allow for analysis across visualizations (Figure 3).

A138,Reflective Data Storytelling for Youth: The CODAP Story Builder,1,1,data story,"Because moments capture a variety of changes ranging from adjusting the location of elements to significant transformations of data, there is a great deal of flexibility in how a Data Story unfolds. Once students are satisfied with their data story, they can ""lock"" the moments bar and make their CODAP document available to others as a standard CODAP file. Locking a Data Story allows viewers of the document to click through and interact with each moment, without editing or overwriting any of the saved work done by the original author. All of the data, visualizations, and other media in Story Builder are still interactive after they are captured in a moment, even when the story is locked. This allows others who are reading a peer’s data story to engage first hand with the data and claims contained therein. 4 ONGOING EVALUATION AND EXAMPLES The Story Builder design is based on preliminary research we con- ducted with 7th grade students in several science classes in a public school that served high proportions of Latinx and emerging mul- tilingual students in a working class suburb of the U. S. state of California during Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. During that study, we piloted two units in collaboration with the classroom teacher. Importantly, the very foci of these units, and the datasets selected for each, were identified by the teacher who had developed her instruction for the year around the themes of diabetes and climate change."

We also collected ad- ditional audio and/or video recordings of daily activities from 2-4 focal groups per classroom (a total of 11 student groups). We also collected screen recordings of all focal group interactions with the CODAP tool. In the first unit, students explored a dataset consisting of com- mercial cereals and interrogated the extent to which the dataset (and common narratives and advertisements about breakfast in the United States) did or did not reflect their actual breakfast con- cerns and choices."
A138,Reflective Data Storytelling for Youth: The CODAP Story Builder,1,1,data storytelling,"In particular, we recognized the need for the following features, which have been incorporated into the current version of the Story Builder plugin: •Rich text that encourages and supported student explana- tions for conclusions drawn from data; 506 Reflective Data Storytelling for Youth: The CODAP Story Builder IDC ’21, June 24–30, 2021, Athens, Greece •Multi-media elements that encourage personalization of data stories; •""Replay-ability"" so that students could refine and continue to interact with data and patterns identified during particular moments during their analysis process. 4.2 Model Data Stories We are developing a suite of example Data Stories using the current version of Story Builder to be used as models for youth. We are seeking to support a diversity of story types (in terms of modality, scope of analysis, and topic) that all illustrate the blending of per- sonal experience/perspective; social issues; and principled analysis and presentation of patterns data. For example, the story featured in Figure 1 documents the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on coau- thor and undergraduate research assistant Damaris Hernandez’s family. It uses these experiences to motivate an exploration of the disproportionate impact of COVID on Latinx families in California."

For instance, the data story featured in Figure 4 begins with an in-depth exploration of the impact of warming temperatures on the country of Lebanon. It then uses different data story moments to compare CO2emissions of people in countries with low poverty rates versus those in countries with high poverty rates using the same graphs highlighted differently. 4.3 Ongoing User Testing We are currently beginning to test Story Builder with adolescent youth ages 10-14.

A150,Pathways: Exploring Academic Interests with Historical Course Enrollment Records,1,1,data storytelling,"It is also an important activity for students in the development of their individual and shared val- ues [ 13,33] and identities [ 60] during university education, which are influential throughout students’ lives beyond finding a job and other utility-driven choices [ 24].Pathways uses data storytelling techniques to provide information on course pathways through a series of interactions and visualizations that encourage students to explore. Data storytelling is commonly used in journalism to communicate insights from data with a specific goal [ 67,68]. It can help convey complex information and guide exploration in a cog- nitively well-paced and compelling manner. While we investigate interest exploration among undergraduates, this approach extends to other contexts, including helping working learners navigate their learning journey outside of formal education. This research makes three primary contributions: first, we de- velop an interactive and scalable tool that promotes interest explo- ration and supports academic decision making; second, we present empirical insights into challenges that impede interest exploration during academic decision making; and third, an empirical validation of the tool offers insights into how it supports students in exploring their interests and academic pathways. 2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Interest Exploration Students who start their university education and realize how many options are available to them tend to ponder an important ques- tion: what am I interested in?"
A150,Pathways: Exploring Academic Interests with Historical Course Enrollment Records,1,1,data storytelling,"Moreover, we intentionally do not “prescribe” choices, but create interactive visualizations to encourage students to take on an active role in exploring options. 2.3 Data Storytelling A common concern with data-driven tools that are exploratory in nature is that they are not actionable or interpretable enough to benefit students [ 21,78]. Students may get lost during exploration and not be able to extract key insights from the visualizations. Data storytelling is a powerful technique to communicate compli- cated information in data and convey ideas to its audience [ 8,23,44]. Specifically, it embeds narrative and structure in a series of data vi- sualizations to highlight insights with an overarching goal [ 28,68]. We adopt an “interactive slideshow” framework for data story- telling in Pathways, which walks students through steps like a slideshow [ 77]. The overall story-line is author-driven but with the overarching goal of promoting interest exploration. In each step, it takes a reader-driven approach for students to explore at the level of courses and entire pathways to ensure a high degree of flexibility while following the overarching narrative. The concept of data storytelling is in popular use today to report news through mass media [ 17,32] and it has been adapted to other areas (e.g., business [ 45,49]), but few studies have applied it in edu- cational contexts [ 29]. Chen and colleagues [ 20] designed narrative slideshows to help educators explore learning patterns in mas- sive open online courses. Martinez-Maldonado and colleagues [ 50] organized data in layers of storytelling in a multi-modal learn- ing analytics system to explain insights to teachers and students. These studies suggest that data storytelling can be successfully applied in educational settings to improve learning experiences, but more work is needed to develop theoretically grounded and learner-centered systems that demonstrate the effectiveness of data storytelling as a communication technique. We adopt data story- telling as an approach in Pathways to promote interest exploration through pathway-finding in a guided manner. 3 FORMATIVE STUDY The process by which students consider courses for enrollment is complex and remains largely unobserved [ 19]. We therefore con- ducted a formative study to investigate the following two research questions: What challenges do students face exploring their inter- ests during course consideration? (RQ1) How do students identify and develop their interests through courses?

We adopted a data storytelling framework to organize the explo- ration process into three interactive steps, each with a specific sub-goal [ 65]. The goal of step one (Search) is to have students reflect on what their interests are and be open to all kinds of ideas. The goal of step two (Course Matches) is to support exploration in the student’s domain of interest by showing a pool of courses that are independently relevant to their stated interest.

While we cannot tell why students took certain courses at certain times, the normative message conveyed by these observations is compelling: there is no standard way of creating a pathway and it is normal to take time to figure it out."

Some data are revealed in the form of data news reports, to relevant professionals, the public, or anyone worldwide who are in need of the data. Therefore, it is of grea t  necessity to translate the data news. Machine translation tools   are frequently made use of, especially some online translation websites. Whether machine translation can replace real translators are in a hot debate. Based on translation typology in  functionalism, this essay mainly compares different machine translation versions of data news, and the essay mainly focuses   on the translation versions from two online translation website s,  namely fanyi.baidu.com, translate.google.cn. II. B ACKGROUND   A. Data News  Data news, which is also known as data-driven news. It is a  new method of news reporting, which is on account of big data  capture, mining, statistics, analysis and visualization. Driven  by  big data technology, data news has made a qualitative and  quantitative leap. News is now closely connected with big data technology, therefore, data news is a natural result. The appearance of data news has been greatly changing the traditional news industry. Up till now, the media companies worldwide that have got  experience in big data news consist of The Washington Post,   The New York Times, and The Guardian , but they are also in  the exploratory stage. Through the research on the big data news practice of representative media at home and abroad, we can summarize the four functions of big data news, namely description, judgment, prediction and information customization. And the features of data news include the following four aspects:   To serve the public interest;   Based on public data;   Relying on the special software program to process the data, mining the news stories hidden behind the macro and abstract data;   Present news in a visual way of image interaction. B. Machine Translation  Machine translation (automatic translation), which is the  course of transferring two natural languages, one of which is the source language, and the other is called the target languag e  through computers. One of the final aims of AI (artificial intelligence) is realize the perfection of machine translation,   which is a part of computational linguistics."

A152,Analysis on Machine Translation of Data News Based on Translation Typology in Functionalism,1,1,data news,"When translating information-based data news,  we should use simple language to express the original meaning of the chart clearly. For example:  ST: 全球新冠肺炎确诊病例攀升过程  TT (a): Global Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Confirmed  Case Climbing Process (translated by Baidu)  TT (b): The Global Rise in Confirmed Cases of New  Coronary Pneumonia (translated by Google)  We can see from the two translation versions above that  translation version of Baidu is a word-to-word translation, some are even Chinese-style English which do not obey the rules of English, especially in the “Climbing Process” part. However, for the translation version of Google, it is generally   correct except for the translation of the proper noun of which  the official translation version is “Novel Coronavirus  Pneumonia”. This piece of data news is informational. The translator  only needs to translate the meaning of the original text. However, the rules of the target language and official translation versions of some proper nouns should be emphasized by the translators. This sentence could be translated as: The Global Rise in Confirmed Cases of Novel Coronary Pneumonia."

Engaging Families with Data through a Personalised Weather Forecast,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Data-driven storytelling techniques ofer a reliable and engag- ing approach to enhance data literacy skills [4, 12, 29], but media  organisations are not widely adopting these approaches. It requires  a too progressive shift within the organisation in terms of content,  production tools and presentation platforms [34]. As journalists  and documentary makers are accustomed to aggregating data into  video stories, the inclusion of interactive data representations in  video ofers a more accessible way for media producers to transition  to data storytelling [15]. Another advantage of video is the presence  of story characters that viewers can relate to, which makes them  empathise with the shared thoughts, and triggers critical refections  on those experiences [21]. These feelings of empathy and consider- ation can be stimulated even more when you personalise stories  based on the viewer’s situation. [8]. Personalised data videos thus  ofer an entry point to engage both media producer and viewer  with data."
A154,More Weather Tomorrow. Engaging Families with Data through a Personalised Weather Forecast,1,1,data stories,"However, few studies have  explored how diferent settings, such as a screen at home or a phys- ical installation at an exhibition; and related social aspects, such as  interacting with children, family or friends, facilitate engagement  with personalised data stories, and in particular, how this afects  critical refection. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a person- alised data video story in the form of a weather forecast that invites  children and their families to interpret historical temperature and  precipitation data. As we encounter weather data every day in var- ious formats (e.g. weather apps, news bulletins, etc.), we chose to  work with this familiar data set in order to address a broad audience  [19]. More specifcally, the design of our personalised data video  focused on both children and adults in order to encourage families  to experience the data video together, and thus collectively make  sense of it."
A154,More Weather Tomorrow. Engaging Families with Data through a Personalised Weather Forecast,1,1,data stories,"Challenges such as  global warming and the Covid-19 pandemic need to be addressed  collectively; social dynamics are thus invaluable for experiencing,  interpreting and sharing data stories. Therefore, we believe our fndings contribute to the understanding of how data videos elicit  collective consumption and sense-making of data.  2 RELATED WORK  Data-driven storytelling techniques are already well-studied to  inform the design of data visualisations for a broad audience [29]. These studies focus on data stories that are distributed via online  platforms or newspapers, while other forms of popular media, such  as television, are often overlooked - despite their potential to reach a  highly diverse audience [11]. Scholars have been exploring the role  of video in data stories [2, 15], and more particular novel interactive  distribution means, such as responsive video technology [8], which  is also being studied in television contexts (e.g. [37]. One of the  benefts of data videos is their ability to emotionally engage viewers  with characters that act as participants in the data story, e.g. [8] or  as presenters, e.g. [15], which triggers refection [8] and stimulates  data exploration [5]. Next, (interactive) television and data videos are often consumed  together with others. In data storytelling, scholars recently explored  how design can further stimulate collaborative analysis, data re- fection and social discussion [25]. Others explored the specifc  setting of classrooms as a way to collectively analyse data through  personalisation [36] or layered story design [18]. In television and  flm, the genre of family flm often takes the form of animated flm  or video, and has mastered the ability to connect with children and  adults simultaneously [20]. Before video streaming platforms were  omnipresent, television channels, and especially public service me- dia channels, directed the programming of their Saturday evening  to families, with the goal of establishing social interaction between  them through game shows and comedy."
A154,More Weather Tomorrow. Engaging Families with Data through a Personalised Weather Forecast,1,1,data story,"We expect that the busy envi- ronment of the cafeteria, i.e. where other visitors are walking and  talking out loud, would distract viewers from consuming the full  data story. We also expect that more social interaction and collec- tive data interpretation with family members would occur at the  exhibition than at home, where they are aso more distracted from  narrative construction, similar to studies in sport video stories [42]. H2. When emotional engagement of participants is high, social  refection is triggered."
A154,More Weather Tomorrow. Engaging Families with Data through a Personalised Weather Forecast,1,1,data story,"We assume that when viewers engage with a  data story together with family or friends, they refect on the rele- vance of the presented data in relation to their family, community  or society as a whole, and discuss it with them. Furthermore, we  expect viewers to be more emotionally engaged with the topic at  the exhibition, since it immerses visitors in a specifc atmosphere. For the condition at the exhibition (CE), we recruited 19 adult  participants at the entrance of the exhibition. The sample existed of  an adult with at least one child younger than 10 years (N = 10), at  least one child between 10 and 16 years old (N = 4), with children  older than 16 (N = 4), or alone (N = 1)."
A154,More Weather Tomorrow. Engaging Families with Data through a Personalised Weather Forecast,1,1,data stories,"CE visitors (N=7) retold the data stories to family bystanders  after they fnished using the application, for example sharing with  each other when the rest of the group was seated in the bar e.g.  ""Look it was often cold when you had your birthday"" - CE P15, ""I saw  that it was 20° on my birthday"" - CE P13. The exhibition was targeted at a young audience, whose knowl- edge of graphs and data is sometimes limited. When asked what  she thought of the graphs, a 10-year-old girl replied: ""I do not even  know what graphs are"" - CE P2. We noted 4 occasions in which  (grand)parents explained to their children the meaning of the dif- ferent lines."

However, the contempla- tiveness scale per condition indicated that participants at the ex- hibition contemplated more about societal challenges related to  the data topic than at home. We thus overestimated the role of  social discussion in refecting on the social relevancy of the topic. The exhibition environment did not contribute to emotional en- gagement with the topic."
A154,More Weather Tomorrow. Engaging Families with Data through a Personalised Weather Forecast,1,1,data story,"Our  fndings revealed how visitors retold the data story from their  own point of view to their family, and even to us, researchers. These stories would often start with a personal hypothesis based  on a memory, followed by the actual data and a refection on its  meaning. Thus, the episodic memory formed the basis to retell  the data story. Our fndings also show that both participants and  visitors were encouraged to enter other episodic dates, such as  summer holidays, wedding dates and even dates when loved ones  had died, which they then compared with the objective data. We  found several visitors took photos of the personalised weather  infographic of family or friends at home, and shared it via social media. The episodic memory thus forms a good basis to retell the  data story. Design recommendation 3. Sharing practice encourages hu- mans to retell the data story, thereby describing data points and  insights. As a result, data story (re-)tellers are familiarised with data. Designers of data video stories could consider including elements  that respond to memories or other social discussion points, such as  famous persons, to facilitate the retelling of data stories.  6.4 A familiar presenter establishes trust and encourages data exploration  At the exhibition, we learned how the presenter’s presence and call  to explore the data became an additional nudge to interact with  the line graphs. For (grand)parents, the inclusion of the familiar  youth news presenter established trust, and made them encourage  their children to further engage with the application. In addition,  when participants recognised the presenter when others were using  the application, they also became driven to fnd him themselves  through the entire data video story. Including a familiar character,  such as a presenter, in a data story formed an additional motivation  to explore the design for those who relate to them (similar to the  presence of famous actors in movies), which appealed to a subset  of the audience. It forms an additional incentive to sustain data  engagement. In addition, a familiar news presenter is a particular  way to establish trust in the information that is conveyed, which is  a strategy already used in the fght against disinformation [13]. Design recommendation 4."
A154,More Weather Tomorrow. Engaging Families with Data through a Personalised Weather Forecast,1,1,data stories,"Furthermore, our  fndings suggest that establishing a connection between data and  memories is a compelling device to foster engagement with data,  and support retelling of data stories, and that a trusted, familiar  presenter can help overcome reticence with more complex types  of data representations. These fndings suggest that professional  data storytellers do not only need to consider the narrative, internal  story design but also the external conditions of story consumption.

B ACKGROUND   With the rapid development of new media technology in  the market, information and resources have undergone  essential changes in the process of social communication. Not only has the communication environment changed with  the update of technology, but also has the means of  information communication changed. Data news is a  new  type of achievement derived from the industry under the  promotion of modern technology. It refers to a new news  reporting mode [1] that describes events by reflecting  certain social phenomena, combined with the capture,  identification, mining, schedul ing, statistics, processing,  analysis and visual expression of events. Compared with the  conventional narrative news, the data news has the  advantages of intuition and visualization, which can make  the audience group more intuitively understand the reporte d  events and content. Its birth not only provides a new  direction for the construction of the news industry, but also  changes the traditional production process of the news  industry to some extent. Data news has the important advantages in describing  the n ews facts, making factual judgment and predicting the  development trend of events. The audience can obtain  higher value information [2] in a shorter time. Literature [3]  combines social media, mobile scenes, audience  characteristics and so on to create per sonalized and  customized multiple scenes, realize the three -dimensional  narrative of news content, and mobilize the audience's  participation in data news. From the perspective of visual  design, literature [4] discusses the visual characteristics,  communica tion advantages, limited development factors of  visual news, and how to do a good job in data visual design. By analyzing the practice and application of data news in the network field, literature [5] believes that data should be  deeply integrated with con tent, and network news should  make better use of big data to show its talents. A large  number of research and reports show that data news is the  general trend of the future development of the news  industry. In order to ensure the authenticity of the news  output data and the quality and representativeness of the  news content, it is very important to make the data better  express the news content, make the public better perceive  and recognize the complex data, improve the data reuse rate,  and realize the conne ction and integration of data,  visualization and narrative. Therefore, the main research of  this paper is to establish the process of data news  production, and focus on the analysis of artificial  intelligence means, to conduct a tentative research on the  production of data news. II. PRODUCTION PROCESS OF DATA NEWS  A. Data and Information Collection  The exploratory data analysis method used in this paper  for information retrieval pays more attention to the  authenticity of the data source. The data set used requires  the true distribution of the data, so the natural text data in  the data published by th e World Bank is selected. Artificial  neuron training method emphasizes the authenticity and  visualization of the data, so that the data analysts can  intuitively see the hidden rules implied in the data."

The BDP is used to generate word  clouds as shown in the figure  [12].

Due to COVID -19, health  has become the focus of intense social attention, and this  paper finally selected health data and news as a sample. B. Information Retrieval and Encoding  Data news is the carrier of data visualizat ion. Its  planning, topic selection, topic extraction, data extraction  and visualization jointly construct data news. Therefore,  after the keyword determination, an important step is the  data encoding. In this paper, the retrieved health hot words  are encod ed one by one, and the representative  characteristics of the construction of data news are  summarized. Each data news appears in one trait or more of  the same characteristics are encoded only once. Through  continuous comparison, discussion and combing, a t otal of  5,819 original statements were obtained, and 10 categories  (X1-X10) were combined and fit out.

C ONCLUSION   Data news can provide personalized services  according to user interaction behavior, and realize  information optimization and data value -added. The  development of  the Internet has enriched the different  types of information terminals. Young readers are more  inclined to use their fragmented time to read high -quality  data news. In data news, infographic charts are suitable  for the expression of narrative spatial stru cture, location  and details, while text is suitable for the transmission of  abstract information, oral concepts and logical conditions. Joint coding of infographic charts and text can activate  various cognitive schema types of readers at the same  time and improve their reading effect. However, data  news is currently in the exploratory stage, and the  accuracy of news generation is not high, and there are still  many obstacles. In the future, it is suggested to expand the  construction of the sample space of da ta news, establish a  professional data news database, and share more data  resources in the government, banking, scientific research  and other fields, so as to improve the accuracy and  readability of data news.

A168,Telling data stories: Essential dialogues for comparative reasoning,1,1,data stories,"Abstract     Language and the telling of data stories have fundamental roles in advancing the GAISE  agenda of shifting the emphasis in statistics education from the operation of sets of  procedures towards conceptual understanding and communication. In this paper we discuss  some of the major issues surrounding story telling in statistics, challenge current practices,  open debates about what constitutes good verbalization of structure in graphical and   numerical summaries, and attempt to clarify what underlying concepts should be brought to  students‟ attention, and how. Narrowing in on the particular problem of comparing groups,  we propose that instead of simply reading and interpreting coded informatio n from graphs,  students should engage in understanding and verbalizing the rich conceptual repertoire  underpinning comparisons using plots. These essential data -dialogues include paying  attention to language, invoking descriptive and inferential thoughts, and determining  informally whether claims can be made about the underlying populations from the sample  data."

The focus on technical capability leads to by -topic organization of the books,  which further leads to everything being dismembered in examples – in one chapter we have a  couple of sentences giving a descri ption, several chapters later a statement that translates the  result of a significance test, and so on. There is no holistic, from beginning -to-end telling of  stories. Effective story telling relies on more than just the structure of stories."
A168,Telling data stories: Essential dialogues for comparative reasoning,1,1,data stories,"First, students have problems when attempting  to tell data stories. Second, teachers themselves often find it very difficult to verbalise about  data and t o know what to draw attention to in order to provide illuminating running  commentaries about “what is going through my mind about this data right now, and why.”  Third, there are deficiencies even in the ways that leaders in statistics education tell storie s  which lead, inadvertently, to sending out confused messages. We believe the way forward is to come up with communication strategies with detailed  exemplars, thus opening the way up for general debates on the pros and cons of the choices  made and altern atives to them. In Section 3 we introduce one set of strategies for addressing  these problems and an exemplar via a teacher guide."

The title of this paper refers to essential dialogues.

Rather, the focus is on the procedures to carry out and possible  worries such as outliers, using the mean, and so forth. Pfannkuch and Horring (2005)   conclude that articulating the messages contained in plots and justifying inferences either  verbally or in writing are difficult problems to resolve for younger students but we believe  that the proble m should be tackled, discussed, debated and not be swept aside. Consider the following excerpt from the GAISE K -12 Report (2007, p. 47)  describing the  comparison of two box plots (Fig. 1)."

That is, the ways of thinking are made explicit rather than being left implicit, as  appears to be the current practice. We also take the opportunity to clarify some statist ical  content issues for teachers, since we know that many of our teachers do not have a strong  statistical background. Therefore our goal in developing this guide is to capture, as well as we can, the complex and  sophisticated thoughts that experts use an d make them explicit and transparent to teachers."

Technology is freeing teachers from the task of focusing their teaching on the construction of  plots. Instead teachers can enhance and promote the true purpose of statistics : to learn more  about real -world situatio ns. This involves drawing inferences from sample data about a wider  universe taking sampling variability into account and making a decision under uncertainty."

How  these elements  combine to  influence user experiences  is complex  and difficult to measure  using empirical methods . This is partly due to the fact that narrative  visualizat ions influence audiences affectively and implicitly [1] – [3]. Evaluation s of narrative visualizations  that aim to better  understand these mechanisms  should capture this rich complexity  by focusing on gathering descriptions of lived experience. Micro - phenomenology, a rigorous set of methods  developed  for soliciting  descriptions of experiences,  has empirically been shown to improve  recollection of otherwise implicit aspects of experience [4]. Building on work using micro -phen omenological interview s to  evaluate static visualization s [5], we apply these methods  to  interactive narrative visualizations. We conducted a small study to  explore the potential of th ese methods  in this context . Our findings  reveal how narrative patterns and designs  influence affective states,  how they support various forms of exploratory analysis, and how  they can facilitate or hinder non -analytical reflection such as the  imagining  of stories described within visualizations . These types of  insights can  inform future designs and help researchers und erstand  how techniques employed in narrative visualizations influence  users in specific and often implicit ways.

Index Terms : Human -centered computing —Visualization — Visualization application domains —Information visualization ;  Human -centered computing —Visualization —Visualization design  and evaluation methods   1 I NTRODUCTION   Narrative visualizations  aim to engage audiences, persuade, and  evoke affective  responses  [3], [6], [7] . Critical to these types of  visualizations is  the evoking of an experiential response that is  beyond simply comprehending the data values. Narrative  visualization designers  use elements like narrative patterns and  structures  [2], [6] , rhetorical devices [1] , and other design featur es  like color and animation [3] to achieve their communicative intent. These elements combine in  ways that com plicate  the evaluation of   these experiential scenario s [8]."

EI was specif ica  lly designed to minimize bias es, like post- rationalization,  that are often involved in introspective interviews  [12].

EI is able to help interviewees gain awareness  of implicit aspects   of experience by focusing on the physical or mental  procedural   actions  [11]."

A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"MPM to reveal implicit aspects experiences ma ke it an ideal tool  for studying techniques used in narrative visualizations such as  those intended to create a sense of flow. Our findings show how  MPM  can be used as an experiential narratological tool revealing  how narrative patterns  are experienced i n the context of their  unfolding, how affective, somatic, and cognitive processes  intertwine and guide the exploratory process, and how participants are provoked to reflect in diverse ways  by various design facets of  narrative visualizations .  2  BACKGROUND   2.1 Affect and Experience in Visualization   Narrative visualizations aim to increase user engagement and  evoke affective responses  [3], [6] . Affect matters for  communicative intent and engagement [3], [6]  and plays i mportant  roles in  visualization [14]–[17]. Eliciting affective states enhances  problem solving and reduces boredom and frustration [14], [18] . Researchers  have shown how visualizations can prime affective  states and how design features such as color and motion can possess rich affective expressiveness [14] –[16]."
A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Interactive visual explorat ory  analysis is  one such task involving intuition [22] and is often  present in narrative visualizations [6] . These two systems are also  present in user engagement which has been defined as the  “emotional, cognitive and behavioral connection that e xists, at any  point in time and possibly over time, between a user and a  resource” [23]. Understanding how a resource, such as a narrative  visualization, influences a user ’s engagement and exploratory  experience requires methods of study that capture the richness and  detail of these relationships.   2.2 Comparison to other methods   MPM and EI complement and extend other t raditional qualitative  methods  used in Human -Computer  Interaction  (HCI ) and  visualization research for studying subjective experiences  [5]. When compare d to MPM, however, observation, diaries,  interviews, and questionnaires either do not capture rich enough   data about personal experiences or suffer from  introducing   potential bias from  post-rationalization [5]."
A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"In the context of narrative visualization,  where designs may influence user experiences and  bias interpretation in various ways,  insights about procedural and  implicit aspects of experience may reveal valuable information that  could be used to inform the design of future visualizations .   2.4 M PM in visua lization  Hogan et al. introduced EI and MPM  to visualization in a study that  focused on static visualizations  to explore the potential of EI as an  evaluation tool.  [5]. They demonstrated how this technique can be  used to gather accounts of lived experiences that capture  hedonistic, emotional, and sensory content, and reveal sense - making processes, personal reflections, and meaning -making  processes [5]. The authors suggested future research should focus  on exploring EI  in interactive visualization contexts [5] , as .   interaction introduces entirely new dimensions to experiences of  visualization, particularly in the context of authored narrative visualizations. Interactions give users a sense of agency, yet can be constrained in a  way that steers them  to interact with predetermined  subsets of data that may influence their interpretations [2].  3 M ETHOD   Our approach is inspired by Hogan et al. for application in  narrative  data visualizations  [5]. Differences in procedure from those  suggested by Hogan et al.  and their rationale are described in  section 4.3. The following section provides a general description of  the structure of EI."

As part of our  study we sought to answer how MPM  could serve as an effective  evaluation technique for narrative visualizations and what unique insights about techniques employed in narrative visualizations it  could reveal. We chose two  contrasting  interactive narrative visualizations  for  our study . The first is the “U.S. Gun Deaths” visualization by  Periscopic (Fig. 1.A.) , which depicts gun -related deaths in the  United States in the years 2010 and 2013 [30]. The visualization  has been praised for being  cinematic and emotionally evocative [3] ."
A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"We chose these two  contrasting visualizations to capture experiences of techniques utilized in both more author -driven and more user -driven  approaches in narrative visualization [6].  4.1 Participants   Six participants ranging between 20 and 30 years of age took part  in the study. Five were male and one was female. The participants had varying degrees of data literacy  and came from a variety of  professional backgrounds  including  painting, t herapeutic  counselling, interaction design, software engineering, neuroscience, and biotechnology. Participants were preferentially selected if they had some form of introspective practice such as  meditation or cognitive behavioral therapy to facilitate th e  interview process and introspective exercise.   4.2 Procedure   3 participants viewed each of the selected visualizations."
A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Our study reveals  further types of insights that could be gleaned from using MPM in  narrative visualizations. In particular, we found MPM effective at capturing aspects of “flow”, which are critical to data stories  [2], in  ways that other methods  Figure 2: Read from left to right.

We found that EI can capture rich  emotional and sensory experiences and reveal sense- making  processes, personal reflections, and meaning -making processes  that  occur when viewing narrative visualizations . Table 1 lists the  various themes we identified in our analysis. These exemplify the  types of  findings that MPM  may reveal in evaluating narrative  visualizations.   5.1 Experiential Narratology   Participants described the experiential unfolding of  the opening  animation sequence of the “U.S. Gun Deaths” visualization."
A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"This description also illustrates  instances where trust and belief  may be affected by strategies  employed in narrative visualizations. Participants often felt their affective  state change as the  exploratory analysis progressed. One participant felt a sense of pride or satisfaction at having correctly had their expectations met: “I started thinking about how that kind of makes sense based on my  experiences and what I know about the area… there was a twinge  of pride or some kind of satisfaction or pleasur e…” [P1 Fig. 1.B ]. Our findings reveal various  affective, somatic, and cognitive  experiences involved in exploring visualizations  and how they may  be supported or influenced by  various strategies."
A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative visualizations facilitate non -  analyt ical reflections  about personal lives,  previous knowledge , and the stories contained  within the data. Our findings demonstrate how data contained  within elements such as tooltips can facilitate,  or hinder one’s  imagining of stories .  6 D ISCUSSION   We found that descriptions of the “U.S Gun Deaths” visualization more frequently described experiences related to what could be  considered intention ally authored  narrative techniques . With some   important exceptions, a  substantial portion of our data relati ng to   the “Plane Truth” visualization focused on decoding the  visualization and usability issues . This may reflect the differences  in the levels of authoring in each visualization."
A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"It could potentially  be due to the limited time allotted for participants to explore visualizations, but it also serves to highlight MPM’s strengths and  weaknesses in evaluating narrative visualizations. MPM is useful  for understanding how  narrative visualizations  accomplish t heir  communicative intent but may be too laborious and time -intensive  for evaluating visualizations as they are being developed. Our study demonstrates the types of insights that can be gleaned  from using MPM for evaluating narrative visualizations . These  methods can provide rich descriptions of experiences , which may  have been occluded had an alternative method been implemented. This serves to reveal how various data storytelling techniques such  16 Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Downloaded on July 19,2023 at 10:59:29 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.  as narrative patterns or rhetoric support the communicative i ntent  of a narrative visualization. The metho d is strong in  preserving  realism. Using MPM on its own or in combination with other  methods can  shed light on  how techniques used in visualizations  achieve their communicative intent and thus inform future desi gns. While MPM has been shown to improve the reliability of  introspective inquiry, the validity of results in individual studies  is  difficult to establish [35]."
A171,A Micro-Phenomenological Lens for Evaluating Narrative Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"An  additional benefit of this structure is that participants are less likely to become fatigued from the long and intensive interview sessions.   6.1 Limitations   Our research has only focused on one case-study of using  MPM  in a narrative visualization context. Our reflections o n MPM as a  tool used for narrative visualizations are limited to the perspective of this single case -study. Additionally, coding and analysis of  transcript was limited to one researcher. Nevertheless, we believe  that the findings from this study demonstrate the affordances of  MPM in evaluating narrative visualizations  and can be extended to  other domains in visualization which have similar aims.   7 C ONCLUSION   We have demonstrated how MPM could be used as a tool for  evaluating narrative visualizations. O ur findings show that it may  be used for revealing experiences of narrative patterns , how visual  rhetoric and design choices can embody and accompany affective  experiences, how the somatic, affective, an d cognitive systems  interact throughout the exploration of a narrative visualization, and how individuals reflect on and make sense of data. Our study touched on questions primarily involved in the user experience  evaluations scenario, but also demonstrated how it may be used in  the communication through visualization and visual data analysis and reasoning scenarios  [9]. Our contributions in this paper are the  introduction of MPM for evaluation narrative visualizations and a   demonstration of and findings from a study using MPM for evaluating narrative visualization. Future research  may focus on further adapting  micro - phenomenological  methods to visualization  and developing ways  of validating findings . One possible avenue for validation would be  triangulation  using other sources of data .

Introduction  Researching the creative process could help to understand how and  why some people are more successful in their creative practices than  others. I came to view creative encounters in science as a form of  game that is used to conduct successful scientific work. Thinking of  creativity as a game benefits scientists in their careers and problem- solving processes by simultaneously keeping them focused and stim­ ulating their motivation."

I  identified various themes describing creativity and creative work. The participants explained themes through metaphors (e.g., game,  puzzle, creative gear, computer, shooting a target). For example, Reijo  used a puzzle metaphor to illustrate themes of dissatisfaction with  previous knowledge, intuition, and cooperation of creative work."

In this story, scientists shared their experi­ ences in academia and interacted with each other, agreeing and dis­ agreeing as to how their creative processes work. Additionally, I  wanted to illustrate the multilayeredness of intuition, incubation,  curiosity, cooperation and solitude, opponents and mentors, and con­ sciousness and subconsciousness.

A173,Creative game in science,1,1,data story,"Commentary on the Collective Story  The collective data story was the form of representation chosen to  illustrate stories and lived experiences of the scientists. Although  the creative processes among these scientists were situated, flexible,  individual, and transformative, common elements of the creativity  game were traced across the interviews and resulted from the cross- case analysis. These elements are presented below, but not in any  specific order, to answer the research questions of ""What is needed  for significant insight to develop and occur?"" and ""How does the  creative game help to understand the structure of problem solving?""  After introducing the elements, which are themes from the inter­ views and from the collective dialogue making the creative game  possible, I ground all four of them into the data, a theoretical frame  of creativity, and into Goffman's theory. I also illustrate the con­ nections among the elements, the findings of previous studies of  creativity, and the data.  • Preconditions of a creative game: A dissatisfaction of previous  knowledge, an ability and intuition to see the interesting and  right problems, curiosity, and competitive mind.  • Physicality (place of the game): An ability to find individual ways to  work comfortably mostly in the backstage by being in nature, in a  sauna, in the shower, for example."

And then I, I try to show them, well, we have four pieces of analysis, and we have all these different, what I call descriptors. Where do we have overlap? Well, that overlap now gives us really cool discussion points when we start  pulling these pieces together.”     The final excerpt introduces an interesting concept of d ata storytelling."
A175,Teaching non-technical skills in a data analytics program in higher education,1,1,data storytelling,"Data storytelling is defined in the literature as an  information compression technique for communicating data insights to an audience using a combination of  narrative and data visualization techniques (Martinez- Maldonado et al., 2020). It has roots in visual design  and often results i n several data stories that are crafted by a data analyst. The analyst identifies key insights  from the data and creates a visualization that highlights a specific insight per data story. For example, a  chart might have the key item of interest highlight ed by changes in size, color, or by adding text or callout  markers to highlight only the data points pertinent to the data story (Knaflic, 2015). This excerpt clearly  illustrates how this professor teaches the narrative form of data storytelling. Communi cating Verbally     Communicating verbally was a theme that emerged with the second highest number of mentions from  participants. The ability to effectively present information orally to different audiences is a key skill for  data analysts. The following excerpts from participants illustrate this theme:     “I think that presentation skills are so important that I incorporate spoken activities with every project  that I do, even the software projects.”     “Verbal communication I think is one of the most important t hings, you know you're going to have to get  up in front of people and you're going to have to be able to talk about your analysis and your findings."
A175,Teaching non-technical skills in a data analytics program in higher education,1,1,data storytelling,"It also parallels quite nicely with the concept of data storytelling and crafting a data story  to illustrate a key insight. Items that do not aid the story should be left out. In particular, chart junk, a term  coined by Edward Tufte (1983) in his book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, should a lso be  avoided. Chart junk is unnecessary content added to charts or visualizations just to fill in empty space."

A179,Techniques for Immersive Data Storytelling,1,1,data storytelling,"Techniques for Immersive Data Storytelling Radhika Pankaj Jain * University of South Australia, Australia ABSTRACT Developments in immersive technologies has led to the emergence of immersive analytics. Immersive analytics takes data visualisa- tion beyond the traditional 2D displays. At the same time, data storytelling has become a prevalent method for communicating data. Combining both data storytelling and immersive analytics gives rise to “immersive data storytelling”. Immersive data storytelling refers to telling visually compelling data stories in an immersive environ- ment such as as virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality and 360 videos. Currently, immersive data storytelling is under-explored from an academic stand point. The research presented here aims to develop techniques and guidelines for effective data storytelling in various immersive environments. Index T erms: Immersive Data Storytelling—Immersive Environments—Wearable Computing—Human-Centered Comput- ing 1I NTRODUCTION Narrative visualisation is a form of data storytelling that aims tohelp communicate a consistent and coherent story described byunderlying data [12]. Narrative visualisation techniques combinedata visualisation and narrative techniques including sequencing, narration, and pacing to deliver an engaging experience and better comprehension of the data. There are many applications of datastorytelling across various domains [9, 11, 13]. Such methods arecrucial in a world challenged with unprecedented crises; COVID- 19, food insecurity, inﬂation, climate change, gender inequality are a few of the many pressing global issues."
A179,Techniques for Immersive Data Storytelling,1,1,data storytelling,"To increase the engagement of data storytelling, the concept of immersive data storytelling is emerging [8]. With the advancements in technology and the commodiﬁcation of virtual reality and aug- mented reality devices, it has become feasible to integrate immersive technology with data storytelling to foster a better understanding of the data. Immersive data storytelling is starting to be used in heath care [6], education [10], manufacturing, and defense and military sectors [4] . Despite of having numerous potential applications, immersive data storytelling is under-explored. More established ﬁelds, such as data visualisation, graphic design, and even cinema, have a rich history of experience and practice. These ﬁelds have well deﬁneddesign patterns (i.e. design solutions or techniques) that may beapplied to particular problems. A design pattern is a common re- peatable solution to a general problem [7]."

Each research question aligns with one of the quadrants of the matrix and each research question will be addressed by a project where every project will leverage techniques from the previous project. RQ1 How should virtual reality (VR) spaces be designed in relation to data visualisation to effectively convey a data story? RQ2 How do we effectively integrate data storytelling (and data visualisation) into 360 videos? RQ3 What are the effective techniques for situated immersive data storytelling?

Effective Design Patterns for Immersive Data Stories The ﬁrst project will address RQ1 by investigating design patterns for virtual spaces in VR which will be a static fully virtual environ- ment to ﬁnd out which design pattern is most effective in conveying a data story in a virtual space. This project will investigate the re- lationship between the virtual space and the data visualisations to identify effective patterns. This project will begin by identifying design patterns from a multi- disciplinary perspective, leveraging techniques from disciplines that have a pedigree in designing physical and virtual spaces, including architecture, museology, and game development. A group of 6–7 domain experts including museologists, architects, design experts, and ﬁlm makers will be interviewed."

Each data story will be of an equivalent complexity using the method proposed by Cao et al. [2]. Information regarding recall, engagement, presence and immersion will collected from the participants using a survey after each condition. 2.2 Project 2.

This project will address RQ2 by engaging 360 videos expert, devel- oping techniques to integrate data visualisation in 360 videos which is a dynamic fully virtual environment and testing the 360 videos with data visualisations through a user study. This project will begin with workshops with 360 videos experts to achieve an understanding about how 360 videos work, and identify how the techniques in Project 1 may contribute to data storytelling in 360 videos. The techniques will primarily focus on how to effec- tively integrate the data visualisations such that they support data storytelling in the video (Figure 2) A group of 15–20 participants will be presented with two 360 videos developed using the techniques curated in phase 1. One with the data visualisations supporting the content of the video and one without any data visualisations.

A186,Automatic Narrative Summarization for Visualizing Cyber Security Logs and Incident Reports,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative visualizations are useful, but common examples use a summarized narrative instead of the full story’s narrative; it is unclear how to automatically generate these summaries. This paper presents (1) a narrative summarization algorithm to reduce the size and complexity of cyber security narratives with a user-customizable summarization level, and (2) a narrative visualization tailored for incident reports and network logs. An evaluation on real incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false positives and improves average precision by 41% while reducing average incident report size up to 79%. T ogether, the visualization and summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst. We further demonstrate that the summarization algorithm can apply to other types of dynamic graphs by automatically generating a summary of the Les Mis ´erables character interaction graph."
A186,Automatic Narrative Summarization for Visualizing Cyber Security Logs and Incident Reports,1,1,narrative visualization,"Hullman and Diakopoulos [14] discuss how a visualization author’s design choices can inﬂuence the audience’s interpretation of narrative visualizations. Automatic text simpliﬁcation and automatic text summarization are two related processes within natural language processing to reduce the size of text. The goal of simpliﬁcation is to reduce linguistic complexity and produce simpler prose [28], whereas the goal of summarization is to reduce the size of a document but retain the important information [10]. There are two general approaches to summarization: extraction and abstraction [10]."
A186,Automatic Narrative Summarization for Visualizing Cyber Security Logs and Incident Reports,1,1,narrative visualization,"Therefore we believe this algorithm has the potential to summarize narratives for use in other narrative visualizations like storylines. Future work should examine how to extend the summarization algo- rithm to also summarize events and relationships. The version presented here focuses on reducing the number of less important entities in the narrative, and only removes a relationship if it is connected to an entity that was removed. This reduces the size and complexity of the narrativegraph, but it may be possible to identify less important relationships and remove them to further reduce the complexity and number of events in the summarized narrative."

This is partly due to the increased interest in data journalism. Besides being engaging, it has been shown to foster better com- prehension and memorability of information to target audiences. The visual data story authoring process involves several stages. However, current tools neither consolidate the visual data story creation process nor integrate the essential features, such as the recommendation of logically sequenced story pieces, for producing coherent narratives. This paper brieﬂy demonstrates our approach and framework for supporting the creation of logically sequenced visual data stories. I. I NTRODUCTION The challenges in constructing and interpreting visualisati- ons have been the target of several works in the information vi- sualisation domain. For example, Lee et al. [1] and Grammel, Tory and Storey [2] have modelled cognitive sensemaking acti- vities in visualisation construction, and outlined the major bar- riers encountered by users and how they construct, understand and interpret visualisations."
A187,A Framework for Authoring Logically Ordered Visual Data Stories,1,1,data stories,"We have previously demonstrated how the adoption of visual data stories, i.e., combining interactive visualisations with storytelling, increases visualisation understanding and memorability [3]. Following this previous work, in this paper, we are presenting our approach and framework for data stories authoring. Most current visualisation tools mainly focus on the exploratory aspect of information visualisation and provide little support for information visualisation presentation goals [4]. Hence, we believe our approach can ﬁll the gap in supporting visualisation authoring and comprehension. Visual data stories often consist of multiple visualisations that serve as story pieces [5]. Also, effectively communicating the visual data story requires specifying an order in which thevisualisation story pieces should be presented. Furthermore, recent researches [6], [7] in narrative visualisation have shown that the order in which visualisation story pieces are presented affects the target audience comprehension and memorability of the information: ineffective sequences increase the cognitive burden on the visual data story audience while optimal se- quences facilitate better sensemaking of the visual data story. In creating visual data stories, users can no longer afford to arbitrarily sequence their visualisation story pieces. Hence, it is crucial for visual data story authoring tools to incorporate effective sequence recommendation features in tool design to assist users in creating logically sequenced visual data stories. We present our approach for recommending and presenting effective visualisation sequences by introducing a framework for the consolidation of the visual data story authoring process. Moreover, we motivate the design of our framework by identifying visual data story authoring tasks. II. V ISUAL DATA STORY AUTHORING TASKS To support the creation of meaningfully sequenced visual data stories, we identiﬁed 6 tasks that our framework should satisfy. These are summarised below: (T1) Support the creation of visualisations as story pieces from raw data; (T2) Support the construction and visualisation of meaning- fully ordered sequence of story pieces; (T3) Support the creation of notes or annotations associated with ﬁndings; (T4) Support insight discovery and modiﬁcation of prior work sessions; (T5) Enable look-up and inspection of fully interactive visua- lisations for more details; (T6) Support the presentation and recording of logically sequenced visual data story for a target audience.

Our framework extends prior works [4], [5] on the visual data story authoring process and consists of three primary loosely coupled components, namely, visualisation, sequence, and presentation components. A. Visualisation Component Visual data stories often consist of multiple visualisations. Thus individual visualisations are story pieces which, when combined meaningfully, forms a uniﬁed theme and supports a coherent narrative. The visualisation component, shown in Figure 1a, supports the creation (T1), inspection (T5), naming and export of individual visualisations either as complete visualisation artefacts or as input to the sequence component, and is loosely coupled to the other components.

It also supports the creation of reference notes (T3) that are dynamically bound to a target visualisation and its corresponding presentation slide, analogous to author notes in presentation software like Powerpoint.

In this subsection, we summarise some key foundations of data visualisation and storytelling, in relation to these constructs, in the form of four principles that we will use later to describe our own LA interface designs. The ultimate aim of data visualisation in LA is to ease educa- tional stakeholders’ cognitive load and facilitate the interpretation of the visual elements used to encode educational data [ 3]."

Authors added narrative to the visualisation to provide an overview of students’ progress and to explain certain data points or changes in the line chart trend. Similarly, Chen et al .

A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"In this paper, we explore how teachers with varying vi- sualisation literacy (VL) skills use LA dashboards enhanced with (explanatory) data storytelling elements. We conducted a quasi- experimental study with 23 teachers of varied VL inspecting two versions of an authentic multichannel dashboard enhanced with data storytelling elements. We used an eye-tracking device while teachers inspected the students’ data captured from Zoom and Google Docs, followed by interviews. Results suggest that high VL teachers adopted complex exploratory strategies and were more sensitive to subtle inconsistencies in the design; while low VL teach- ers benefited the most from more explicit data storytelling guidance such as accompanying complex graphs with narrative and semantic colour encoding.

A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"We conducted a quasi-experimental study with 23 teachers with varied VL skills inspecting two ver- sions of a LA dashboard enhanced with data storytelling elements in the context of synchronous online collaborative learning. We applied eye-tracking and qualitative methods to identify potentially distinct strategies followed by teachers with low and high levels of VL to make sense of the dashboards. 2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Visualisation Guidance and Data Storytelling in Education Visualisation guidance refers to design features aimed at reducing the complexity and cognitive load associated with the interpreta- tion and sense-making of data visualisations [ 42]. Guidance in this sense involves the provision of supportive elements in the data interface itself (e.g., in the form of direct annotations, signposting or emphasised elements) to orient or steer the interaction with the data representations thus reducing the need for training end-users on the selected visualisation techniques or, in other words, narrow- ing their knowledge gap [ 9]. One way to provide such visualisation guidance is by applying the notion of data storytelling (DS). DS is an information compression technique that can be applied to help an audience focus on responding to specific questions by combining charts, text and other resources to emphasise the data points and the evidence that are more relevant to such questions [34]. There has been a growing interest in applying DS elements to improve the explanatory features of data visualisation to support teachers’ interaction with LA interfaces [ 24]. For example, Chen et al. [10] proposed a drill-down narrative storytelling approach toguide teachers in navigating various “data slices” generated from MOOC data."
A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"Against the literature discussed above, we address this gap by raising the following research questions: RQ1: How do teachers with varied visualisation literacy skills use LA dashboards with data storytelling enhancements?; and RQ2: To what extent do data storytelling elements support teachers in making sense of students’ activity? 3 METHOD 3.1 The Learning Situation We addressed our research questions in the context of the human- centred design process of a teacher-focused dashboard deployed as a part of the graduate course IT research methods atundisclosed university to support teachers in monitoring synchronous online learning tasks. In this course, students engaged in weekly 3-hour online classes facilitated by two teachers. Students commonly per- formed a range of tasks by forming small groups of 4-6 members, using audio-visual and text-based tools (namely, Zoom and Google Docs). The types of tasks ranged from those where students were expected to discuss a topic to those where the main output was a written report."
A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"The use of data storytelling elements has not been previ- ously evaluated. These and the differences between versions 1 and 2 are described below. 3.2.1 Data storytelling elements. Based on [ 16], we implemented both versions of the LA dashboard with the following data story- telling elements: DSa) teacher’s questions (defined by teachers in a previous study focused on the design of the dashboard [ 36]) as the titles of corresponding charts (see Fig. 1, Ch1-5); DSb) colour emphasis (or semantic colour encoding), where three contrasting colours are consistently used to emphasise elements in a colour- blind friendly manner (grey and navy blue used for most visual elements, whereas orange and red are used to emphasise cases that may need closer attention); and DSc) textual narrative (see Ch1 and Ch4 in Fig. 1) explaining students’ behaviours. 3.2.2 Interface design. Both dashboard versions provide the same information using six and five charts, respectively. The first is a timeline chart shown at the top of the interface depicting the activity where the class is (see T on version 1 in Fig. 1 containing three activities and the start and final times of the class). The number of activities can be configured by the teacher at the beginning of each class to reflect their class script."

This is also in line with recent attempts to enhance comprehension of more complex charts by combining them with textual narratives and semantic colour encoding [ 11,26]. Additional emphasis was added to the bar chart labels (e.g., Fig. 1 – orange labels in Version 2 – Ch3) aiming to drive attention to areas that teachers should pay attention to. This resulted in, to some extent, version 2 being more decluttered than version 1. 3.3 Participants A total of 24 teachers (13 females, 10 males) between 22 and 60 years old (𝑀=31,𝑆𝐷=8) participated in the study."

A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"The same set of questions was asked for each data storytelling element described in Section 3.2, namely a) teachers’ questions, b) colour emphasis, and c) textual narratives) to explore the participants’ perspectives. For instance, a set of questions asked to the participants regarding the colour emphasis in one of the charts looked like: “To what extent would you consider [colour emphasis] being helpful for you to understand what the chart was communicating about students’ activity? If so, which colour emphasis was helpful? How did it help?"

A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"This was followed up by the discussion of an initial coding technique [41], where a first-level code represents one of the categories of data storytelling elements we asked participants about (i.e., the role of: i) teachers’ questions; ii) colour emphasis; and iii) textual narrative). A fourth code emerged from the first code (code: em- phasised elements) since several teachers talked comprehensively about the use of colour mapping in the LA dashboard (code: ‘colour mapping’). Each first-level code included two second-level codes to contrast the perspectives of teachers in the high and low VL groups.For code ‘colour mapping’, we applied an affective coding to iden- tify participants’ sentiments [ 41] towards the enhancements. The coding scheme is available online."
A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"But the low VL teachers benefited the mostfrom more explicit data storytelling guidance, for example, moving textual explanations closer to the sociogram charts. Yet, the quan- titative analysis did not shed light regarding to what extent other data storytelling elements (such as emphasis using colours) shown inside some charts may have been used during the interpretation process. These are addressed in more detail in the next section. 4.2 RQ2: Qualitative results In this section we present our results from the qualitative analysis regarding the role of i) questions as titles (DSa); ii) emphasised elements (DSb), iii) colour semantics (DSb), iv) textual summaries (DSc). 4.2.1 Questions as chart titles. Participants with both high (P4, P8, P10, P9) and low (P3, P6, P7, P11, P12, P15) VL groups appreciated the presence of questions explicitly indicating what insights might be extracted from the corresponding charts. As illustrated by P4 (high VL): ""I definitely liked how visualisations are linked to the ques- tion that best matches it."
A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"That’s impor- tant information. "" This suggests that while the high VL teachers may have been capable of interpreting complex graphs (such as the sociograms) by themselves, the low VL teachers could benefit from more explicit data storytelling guidance in the form of textual summaries and high VL teachers can still benefit from them under regular class time constraints.5 DISCUSSION 5.1 Research questions Regarding RQ1, results from the eye tracking analysis suggest that high VL teachers can show more explicit information searching behaviours by i) identifying and utilising related charts during their interpretations; ii) interpreting charts with more scrutiny against their corresponding explanatory chart titles; and iii) recognising emphasised elements which might be instrumental to aid interpre- tation. Teachers in the low VL group benefited more from changes in the design, for example, bringing textual summaries closer to the sociograms. This emphasises the importance of designing ex- plainable data interfaces in education [ 15]. Our quantitative results suggest that adding explainable [ 24] or information guidance [ 42] features to LA dashboards may benefit teachers with low VL the most."
A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"Although both low and high VL participants appreciated the en- hancement of the charts using data storytelling elements, teachers in the low VL group could not always retell the principles upon which emphasis was applied to some charts such as the meaning of some colour variations. Yet, the sentiment towards the helpfulness of colour was more positive for the low VL teachers compared to those in the high VL group. This suggests that for teachers with low VL literacy emphasising key data points with colour can support interpretation but the design should very explicitly explain how colour is used to convey meaning or some basic training may still need to be provided but focused on VL. This empirically confirms the potentially positive role of dashboards with data storytelling enhancements [ 10,18], especially for supporting teachers with low VL. In contrast, teachers in the high VL group showed more complex dashboard inspection strategies both in the eye tracking analysis and in the ways they explained how often they used the charts by combining them to make sense of students’ activity. This finding is supported by visualisation literacy literature which explains that VL skills can enable the effective exploration of data visualisations [27]. Moreover, incorporating text into dashboards may benefit teach- ers regardless of their VL."
A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"However, even though using text as an alternative to com- municating LA outputs to teachers has been suggested in previous research [ 18], more research is still needed to understand in which situations teachers would benefit from specific data storytelling and narrative techniques. For instance, Van Leeuwen and Rummel [49] found that teachers need more time to interpret groups’ progress in dashboards where charts are displayed along with the descriptive text. Our study adds another dimension to these previous studies by suggesting that the effectiveness of providing text in dashboards may depend on teachers’ VL. For example, while some teachers may benefit from explicit textual explanations, these may also require teachers to have the skills to effectively integrate evidence from two different modalities: text and visual charts."
A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"Investigating visualisation literacy in connection to data storytelling interfaces is important because it can enable the provision of targeted support for user groups of varying abilities to utilise information from visu- alisations. Although increasing general levels of VL among teachers might be an unattainable goal [ 50], providing intelligent interfaces that account for differences in VL can be an attainable aim [ 12]. Yet, future works can further investigate to what extent teachers need to develop visualisation literacy skills in order to effectively interact with a range of LA end-user interfaces and dashboards. 5.3 Implications for design practice Some implications for LA design emerged from our study. While our results suggest that enhancing LA visualisations with text may support teachers regardless of their VL levels, this feature should be added in alignment with the context of use for avoiding text to become a distraction [ 49]."
A189,How Do Teachers Use Dashboards Enhanced with Data Storytelling Elements According to Their Data Visualisation Literacy Skills?,1,1,data storytelling,"More work would need to be done to understand how the findings are applicable to other contexts. 6 CONCLUSION Results from our study indicate that a) high VL teachers adopted exploratory strategies when using two dashboard versions; b) low literacy teachers find it problematic to immediately figure out how to use visual enhancements from various visualisations; yet, they benefited the most from more explicit data storytelling guidance. Hence, to make a difference, dashboard designers should very ex- plicitly couple such visual enhancements for low VL teachers to benefit from them. However, this raises the question of how to per- sonalise teacher-facing interfaces to provide equal support for both high and low VL teachers. This paper should be seen as the first of further work needed to understand the potential interplay between visualisation literacy and design enhancements in LA dashboards."

We start by explaining why the mere act of visualization can be highly useful to readers, helping them discover patterns and com- prehend information. Backed by historical references, we will describe how some of the rst data visualizations were used to explain facts, understand certain events, and deter- mine courses of action. We will then outline how storytelling and narrative techniques are being currently used with data visualization to leverage the power of visual expression."

An excellent example of consi- dering experience as part of this process is the project \The Fallen of World War II"" by Neil Halloran [9], where a data visualization of the number of dead civilians and soldiers during World War II is presented in an interactive and ci- nematic form, and the experience of the ravages of war is clearly palpable in the presentation of the data of the loss. 2.2 Data visualization It is usual to think about data visualization as a modern application in statistical graphs and charts, where it nds its wider and most common application. But in reality, \the modern representation of quantitative information has deep roots"", and we can trace them all the way to the earliest applications in cartography and statistical graphics [10]. Although data visualization techniques have been studied and developed during the last 20 years, like the recent exam- ple in the melding of storytelling and visualization, the Gap- minder [11] project, information visualization examples have been created to show and explain certain events throughout history."

Data, by itself, is an intrinsic form of information. This information has to be extracted by following often technical and rigorous procedures of clea- ning, structuring, and sorting, so the data becomes unders- tandable before visualization techniques can be applied to it, paving the way to the crafting of a coherent story. \Story is an interactive form of communication, where information is brought into a context that people can understand, remem- ber, discuss and tell others about"" [20]. In this sense, the two main reasons to use visualization as a form of presenta- tion in news stories are: exploratory , to understand what is present in the data; communicative, to display and discuss visualizations with the public by telling stories based on the data and the facts."
A195,Telling Stories with Data Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Drawing from news media data visualization to identify distinct genres of narrative visualization, the seminal work by Segel and Heer [22] oers a clear and concise study of nar- rative visualization and storytelling with data. They were able to develop a framework that suggests design strategies for narrative visualization in journalistic storytelling, in or- der to prevent certain diculties presented when the user is given too much freedom and control over the narrative. Segel and Heer placed narrative visualizations in a spec- trum of author-driven and reader-driven approaches. In an author-driven approach, the structure of the visualization is strictly linear and includes no interactivity; its main advan- tage is ecient communication. The purely reader-driven approach is highly interactive and it doesn't oer a clear path of the story; its best used when discovery tasks are to be performed to formulate hypothesis. Figure 4 shows the three structures or narrative strategies introduced by Segel and Heer."
A195,Telling Stories with Data Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"However, it still requires a high level of authoring to determine where the interactions are going to take place. 9 Figure 4: Segel and Heer's narrative visualization structures [22]. 3.3 User Interpretations Hullman and Diakopulus [23] take the research a step further by taking into account the rhetorical techniques used to inuence user interpretation, an aspect often excluded from InfoVis research, functioning as a way to understand what is called\framing eects""[24] relevant to InfoVis, where small changes in visual ndings can produce changes in opi- nion. Their visualization rhetoric framework introduces the term editorial layers that include the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity, where dierent rhe- torical techniques can be applied to the construction of nar- rative visualizations and convey meaning. The decision ma- king process of a designer entails a series of conscious choices to add information (in the form of suggestions), or to omit information, thus aecting the end-user interpretations. 4. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK Without storytelling techniques\visualizations are not able to provide explanations about the subject and depend too much on the audience's ability to interpret the data cor- rectly"" [25]."
A195,Telling Stories with Data Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Considering this balance as a starting point to convey meaning in InfoVis strategies may be the greatest contribution made by Segel and Heer [22] in their framework for narrative visualizations. An interesting consideration in the analysis of narrative visualization is the level of persuasion and inuence in the end-user's opinion of the overall story, when persuasive and rhetorical strategies are introduced in the visualization. The decision to employ these strategies, permeate the overall suc- cess or failure of the visualization and harness great power when used as a narrative technique in data journalism, when they leverage the ecacy of visual perception to communi- cate ecient ideas. Consequently, news media plays an im- portant role in how topics of dierent natures are perceived by public opinion since it has increased in adoption by blogs [26] and mainstream news media alike."
A195,Telling Stories with Data Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"Segel and Heer [22] propose that new research should be conducted by focusing exclusively on the reader's experience and behavior when interacting with narrative visualizations. Similarly, the need to understand the mechanism of rhetorical devices and ways of communicating meaning was identied by Hullman and Diakopoulos [23]. A meaningful set of research questions proposed by Figueiras [29] articulate very succinctly new avenues of research in narrative visualization: what makes it work (level of knowledge communica- tion); which of the narrative visualizations that are being produced in news media, advertising, research, educa- tion, etc. are having the desired eect on users; how and where should narrative elements be placed; how should the story be structured; what is the impact of these stories on the users. What became evident in this preliminary research of the storytelling space in the eld of information visualization is that it's\starting to take shape""[25], and there are prevalent discussions that are taking place to articulate well grounded techniques and conventions to produce the desired commu- nication with the audience. 5.

EXTENDED ABSTRACT To explore the effects of visualization tools on the public’s perception of risk, we conducted a three-part qualitative survey, content analysis, and interview study. Our aim was to identify the most common visualization tools used by the public to learn about potential hurricane paths and risks; assess these tools according to information visualization principles to determine to what degree they rely on narrativizing hurricane risk; and connect the narrative aspects of visualization tools with their influence on the public’s anxiety, risk perception, and resulting hurricane preparedness. In this presentation, we discuss preliminary results and discuss connections to the technical communication and risk communication literature."

Recent research in behavioural economics suggests that such narratively driven approaches to information design (in particular, their reliance on metaphor), engage ‘System 1’, or intuition-based, thinking (Kahneman 2011), and hence have a strong impact on decision-making. Narrative visualizations are thus a crucial tool in the growing field of  financial literacy. The 2008 recession prompted governments and non-profit organizations in the United States and other countries to step up their efforts to improve financial literacy among the public (cf. the Financial Literacy Research Consortium, http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/flrc-pr.htm ). As with  public health and other areas of public importance, one of the key research and funding priorities has been to develop more effective communication  strategies and educational resources. Existing financial literacy materials  –  however thoroughly planned and assessed – often lack consistent design methodologies. (N.B. for policy-makers, the word ‘design’ usually connotes only the design of research instruments such as surveys or studies.) This lack of methodologies presents a significant opportunity for design educa - tors and designers in the twenty-first century."
A209,Teaching the design of narrative visualization for financial literacy,1,1,narrative visualization,"In the design classroom, finan - cial literacy provides an excellent context for students’ exploration of narrative visualization; financial literacy also provides opportunities for students to broaden their skills in information design to include a wider range of visuali - zation strategies. This article is in two parts. In Part 1 the authors define ‘narrative visualiza- tion’ and discuss its reliance on visual metaphor. We relate the emotional and cognitive impact of narrative visualizations to recent research in behavioural economics regarding individuals’ interpretation of information and financial decision-making. In Part 2 we apply these insights to a case study in which design educators and financial educators collaborated to approach financial literacy as a ‘design problem’. Design students were paired with students in a financial literacy-training programme to identify issues of critical importance to the future counsellors’ clients (e.g. dealing with poor credit scores); the design students were then tasked with creating short time-based animations that could serve as financial literacy instructional materials. To analyse the finished products, we develop a conceptual framework that  identifies crucial factors of an effective narrative visualization, and use the framework to analyse an example of student work. Finally, we suggest that this framework could be extended to development of assessment tools. Part I: narratIve vIsualIzatIon and behavIoural  economIcs Defining ‘narrative visualization’ The authors define narrative visualization as illustrations, animations, story - boards and graphic novels that engage the viewer with metaphor and story-telling. This is very different from the data-driven use of the same term by researchers such as Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer (2010) from the computer-and graphics-oriented Stanford VIS group ( http://vis.stanford.edu /): they  ADCHE_12.2_Fry_Overby_159-177.indd   160 5/1/14   1:13:03 PM Teaching the design of narrative visualization for financial … 161emphasize the story-telling aspects in visualizations of complex data sets and  other schematics. In contrast, the authors’ (Parsons) definition of ‘narrative visualization’  refers to the kinds of illustrations that are frequently used to explain financial  concepts and elements in financial journalism and financial education mate - rials (see Figure 1). Largely hand-drawn and pictorial – combining simple  imagery with graphic elements – these visualizations use metaphors and implied relationships to imbue complex financial concepts with emotional or  conceptual context. These narrative visualizations often depict emotional cues  (pain, fear, joy) overtly through a character’s body language and facial expres - sion when referencing issues that have emotional resonance for the viewer. This resonance allows viewers to engage with the concepts on an intuitive basis: one that relates to heuristic-based ‘System 1’ thinking (Kahneman  2011). As we discuss in the section ‘Two systems thinking’ below, the intui - tive engagement that narrative visualizations engender may have a significant  impact on financial decision-making and behaviour. Comparison of these two examples highlights some differences between  data-based and narrative-based visualizations. The visualization in Figure 2 lies somewhere along a continuum ranging from ‘pure’ information/data- driven to ‘pure’ pictorial/narrative, and integrates elements of both. Figure 2  illustrates the ways in which metaphors can be embedded deeply and implicitly in a visualization that would otherwise seem primarily schematic."

The narratives are composed of sequences  of events that overlap chronologically; one fuels a speculative frenzy while the  other results in financial crisis. Both sequences of events are framed by two overarching metaphorical associations: green=proceed/safe; red=stop/danger. As the sequence of events and actions accelerates, the background shifts  from neutral (or possibly clear) blue sky to green, and then from blue sky to red."
A209,Teaching the design of narrative visualization for financial literacy,1,1,narrative visualization,"Besides asserting that the depiction of emotional content is information  visualization (of a different kind from data visualization), the authors contend  that the role of metaphor in conveying emotional – and other – content, in  these narrative visualizations has been insufficiently studied. Like the disci - pline of rhetoric more generally (Engbers 2014), metaphorical devices have historically been associated with language, and only in the last few decades has interest in their visual representations been examined in any systematic  fashion in the design context. Recent studies include the role of metaphor in  advertising (Forceville 1996), corporate branding (Koller 2009; Engbers 2014), and editorial cartoons of political issues (El Refaie 2003, 2009) and the 2009 financial crises (Bounegru and Forceville 2011). Because images are frequently  embedded in complex texts, formal analyses have expanded to include multi - modal forms (Forceville 2008; O’Halloran 1999)."
A209,Teaching the design of narrative visualization for financial literacy,1,1,narrative visualization,"The metaphors used in narrative visualizations thus do more than provide  convenient visual symbols for abstract concepts. They draw upon and reinforce existing conceptual frameworks. This process is similar to ‘genre recognition’  (Trogu 2013), which allows readers to infer broader and richer attributes than  those presented at face value. For example, the use of the credit card to repre - sent a potential financial/physical abyss in Figure 1 is made more powerful by the conceptual (and experientially familiar) association of ‘falling’ with  ‘danger’ and our likening the feeling of being in debt with that of insecurity."

Based on clinical and observa - tional studies documenting people’s attitudes and decision-making around money, behavioural economics encompasses work by economists, psycholo - gists and cognitive scientists. Herbert Simon (1957) observed the limitations of time, information and cognitive ability that individuals face in making complex decisions, and coined the phrase ‘bounded rationality’ (Note similarities with the idea of the ‘four-second window’ [Trogu 2013]). Citing clinical and obser-vational studies, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman published a series of influential papers (1974, 1979, 1981, 1986), defining a number of systematic biases regarding probability and risk."

The taxpayer (shown as a boat) is imminently threatened  by Fannie Mae (overweight individual), while Freddie Mac, equally overweight,  passively waits to be rescued from the roof of one of many ‘underwater’ houses. The significant frame shift between the two images is in the ways these  agencies are understood. In the first illustration the reference point for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is represented by hands of a vulnerable man in urgent need of rescue; in the second Freddie and Fannie are seen as perhaps equally in need of rescue, but undeserving of it, putting their own survival selfishly and recklessly ahead of that of both the underwater homeowners and the US taxpayer."
A209,Teaching the design of narrative visualization for financial literacy,1,1,narrative visualization,"Narrative visualizatioN The authors assert that visual metaphor is central to the effectiveness of financial communication through narrative visualization for the following three reasons: 1. By being visual, illustrative metaphors engage perceptual intuition. Colour, texture, the angle of a gaze, the tilt of a head, all offer very subtle yet unmistakable cues that are understood at the very instant they are perceived. System 1 thinking is primordial: it will instantly detect a sharp look, a change in the environment or a subtle variation in tone of voice."

A209,Teaching the design of narrative visualization for financial literacy,1,1,narrative visualization,"Although the Design 4 course was originally configured to teach informa - tion design through the graphical representation of data, the explicit purpose of ‘Design 4: Visualizing Finance’ was to teach ‘narrative visualization’. This was an ambitious goal: first because a course based on conventional informa-tion design should ideally precede one based on narrative visualization, and second because narrative visualization demands a variety of complex interpre - tations and analyses, the totality of which are difficult to accomplish within fifteen three-hour weekly class meetings. The final and principal project in the course was creation of a brief video  or animation depicting a financial decision-making process and incorporat - ing data and financial concepts. This represented The Visualizing Finance Research Lab’s first attempt at implementation of some of the design insights described in this paper, beginning to develop and test a methodol - ogy for creating narrative visualizations in both academic and professional contexts. collaboratioN For this project, the Design 4 class partnered with a class called ‘Personal and Consumer Finance’, at The City University of New York’s professional-development evening school for working adults.

Outcome This project is a 3:12-minute key-frame partially animated narrative with sound and voice-over. The visual style uses simple vector-based graph - ics (similar to those used in the television animation South Park) over photographic montages that range from the interior of a church to a collage of credit cards.

These ideas are delivered largely through  setting, character, body language and facial expression.

Introduction The ability to process data, extract value from it and communicate the results in a meaningful way is extremely important in data journalism [ 1], geovisual analytics [ 2], geomarketing [ 3], and many scientiﬁc ﬁelds. The terms “data storytelling” or “data-driven storytelling” have been used to refer to how insights are uncovered from data and communicated to others effectively so that they can be translated into actions or changes [ 4]. In the ﬁeld of journalism, the best way to relay stories with a spatial component is often through the use of maps [ 5]; in geovisual analytics, the maps and supporting visualizations used to describe multivariate data are sometimes best understood through a story telling process [ 2]. As such, data journalism and geovisual analytics have contributed to the rise of geovisual stories or story maps, a type of data storytelling using maps, texts, photos, and graphs [ 6–8]. A rise in geographic and multimedia tools on the web has expanded the ability and audience for storytelling through maps, and there are multiple platforms available for experts and non-experts alike [ 7]. The explosive popularity of story maps is underscored in the recent release of a web-based version of Google Earth that features “Voyager”, a collection of map-based stories written by Google Earth partners, updated weekly. The Voyager platform will eventually be made available to the public for building custom story maps, with the aim of bringing a storytelling aspect to Google’s popular mapping service [9]."
A212,Digital story mapping to advance educational atlas design and enable student engagement,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Despite the history of telling stories with maps in atlases and in journalism, and the recent popularity of data-driven storytelling and web-based story mapping, there are not yet many studies speciﬁcally addressing story mapping. This study focuses on digital story mapping to advance educational atlas design and enable student engagement. Using a survey and classroom observation, this study explores what practices are best for story mapping in this capacity and what challenges arise with its use in the classroom. The study also aims to evaluate student engagement with a story map atlas in comparison to a traditional paper student atlas."

This broader understanding of how digital storytelling is being used in different ﬁelds will then be related to the development of an online, interactive student atlas using a story mapping platform. 1.1. Storytelling in Business and Journalism Data-driven storytelling, or presenting data in a way to inﬂuence business decisions or to highlight a journalistic investigation, has its roots in data visualization [ 1,19]. The distinction between exploratory analysis and explanatory analysis illustrates the importance of data-driven storytelling [ 19]. Exploratory analysis involves exploring and analyzing data to ﬁnd out what might be noteworthy or applicable to solving a problem. In contrast, explanatory analysis is taking the time to turn the data into information that can be consumed by an audience, and includes storytelling. It involves understanding the audience and the context, ﬁltering the data to address the audience and context, ﬁnding the most effective visualization of the ﬁltered data, and ﬁnally highlighting the conclusion, ISPRS Int."
A212,Digital story mapping to advance educational atlas design and enable student engagement,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"In narrative visualization (the term for data-driven storytelling in the ﬁeld of data visualization) studies have focused on different genres, design patterns, types of visualizations, and rhetorical devices used in narrative visualizations [ 1]. Similar to story mapping technology, a number of systems and tools for telling data-driven stories exist, but little research has been conducted in the design and effectiveness of these tools. Interaction in stories is identiﬁed as needing more research, as one study concludes there is “no guarantee that interaction inherently increases reader engagement” [ 20] but another contends that “authors can utilize well-designed interaction to make reader experiences more effective and, simply, more fun” [1]. Popular techniques were identiﬁed in a survey of 45 data-driven stories [ 1], some of which may be applicable to story mapping (in fact, seven of the 45 stories included maps)."
A212,Digital story mapping to advance educational atlas design and enable student engagement,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Annotation of visualizations (as distinct from labels) are considered to be an important technique in effective data-driven storytelling. One data journalist specializing in maps places very high importance on annotations [5], likening them to “a museum docent, politely explaining the complicated parts of the story”. Visualizations with simple interaction like tooltips were also common, but interactions such as brushing, linking, and ﬁltering were less common. Brushing, linking, and ﬁltering are quite common in exploratory visualizations, so it is noteworthy that they are used less frequently in explanatory visualizations."

A212,Digital story mapping to advance educational atlas design and enable student engagement,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Geovisual Storytelling for Education The storytelling structure of the atlas story maps for educational purposes was informed by three areas of study: (1) use of geospatial technologies such as digital globes and web maps in education; (2) data-driven storytelling in journalism, particularly insights from data journalists that specialize in maps; and (3) place-based learning strategies. A review found that virtually all studies of middle school learning through inquiry with geospatial technology have found improved achievement, attitudes, and self-efﬁcacy [ 49]. Using examples of lesson plans developed for use with geospatial technologies, such as “Geoinquiries” [ 50], the story map text includes instructions for interacting with the map in order to explore spatial patterns and questions to prompt thought about possible explanations. Second, insights from journalists that specialize in maps indicate that personalization and localization are two important aspects of storytelling [ 5]."
A212,Digital story mapping to advance educational atlas design and enable student engagement,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Digital text was written using inquiry-based lesson plans and data-driven storytelling techniques as models. The role of the text in the story map was to provide deﬁnitions, background, and supporting details to the maps, and to guide students in exploring the map to ﬁnd patterns and connections between locations in order to highlight conclusions. Future research opportunities expanding on this work could focus on evaluating the text in story maps used for educational purposes. One study has already found that teachers view story maps as a tool to better present material that meets academic standards [ 12], and this indicates the importance of evaluating story maps—both maps and text—as an academic resource."

Keywords   Datasets, data stories, research data management, scholarly  communication, data narratives    INTRODUCTION   Data narratives or data stories have emerged as a new form  of the scholarly communication focused on data. DataONE, the federated framework of Earth Sciences data  centers, is publishing data stories in blogs and as part of  its training and education modules (Rebich Hespanha,  Menz, & Bragg, 2013). In the field of librarianship and  information science, one finds the Data Curation Profiles  that were developed to help librarians understand the needs  and requirements of researchers for data curation and  preservation  (Witt, Carlson, Brandt, & Cragin, 2009). Other disciplines are also turning to narratives as an  additional element useful to elucidate questions. In   medicine, narrative inquiry focuses upon a single case, as  opposed to evidence-based medicine that focuses on  populations (Bleakley, 2005)."
A214,Data narratives: Increasing scholarly value,1,1,data stories,"In this paper, we explore the potential value of data  narratives and the requirements for data stories to  enhance scholarly communication. We take the position  that these data stories will increase the value of the  research if they are structured and adhere to stringent  criteria, or are peer-reviewed . If they are not, they have  instructional value as they provide a human dimension to  the data and research process. The first part of this paper focuses on identifying different  kinds of data stories. The second part of the paper  examines the role of data stories and their potential impact. The third part discusses our findings and proposes  some requirements that would increase their potential  value. We leave data stories in medicine and statistics  out of the scope of this paper, as they are discipline  specific and serve a narrowly focused purpose. DATA STORIES/NARRATIVES/DESCRIPTIONS   In this section we describe data stories that have different  degrees of structuring, from the DataONE data stories,  to the Data Curation Profiles, to the Scientific Data  publication. DataONE’s  Data Stories   DataONE data stories are the products of 30 to 60 minute  semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews with 24  researchers that exemplify both satisfying and  challenging experiences related to data (Rebich  Hespanha, et al 2013). They vary widely in content,  length, issues addressed, and purpose. Some stories go  to great length to describe the data collection, storage  and access mechanisms, intention to share, and some data  pre-processing steps that help contribute to the quality  assurance performed on the data. An example of such a  story, “Tallying  every bug and byte”  recounts how a  dataset counting insect species at over 40 sites over  several years collected by a retiring professor piqu ed   77th ASIS&T Annual Meeting , October 31 - November 4 , 2014 , Seattle,  WA, USA."
A214,Data narratives: Increasing scholarly value,1,1,data stories,"We now turn our attention to a different type of data stories,  the Data Curation Profile (DCP). Data Curation Profiles as Narratives   Unlike the DataONE stories, DCPs are the results of highly  structured interviews of individual researchers about their  data management practices in their research or about one  particular project (Witt, et al, 2009). DCPs provide  information about a particular dataset or collection of  datasets, the steps the researcher is taking to manage or  curate datasets, and what the researcher would like to do  about the data, highlighting unmet needs. The DCPs are the  results of collaborative work between data librarians,  library liaisons, and researchers, including faculty or  graduate students."
A214,Data narratives: Increasing scholarly value,1,1,data story,"We will now examine another type of data story: the  articles published in “Data  Journals”  using the example  of the Scientific Data (SD) journal. Scientific Data’s  Data Descriptors as Scientific  Products  Data Journals are “a new format of publication  that focuses on the dataset rather than the results of an  analysis or the investigation of a scientific hypothesis” . Scientific Data is an open-access, peer-reviewed  publication for descriptions of scientific datasets initially   15508390, 2014, 1, Downloaded from https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/meet.2014.14505101088 by Hong Kong University Of, Wiley Online Library on [19/07/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License  focused on the life, biomedical and environmental  science and the description of the experimental settings  used to collect the data."
A214,Data narratives: Increasing scholarly value,1,1,data stories,"VALUE OF DATA NARRATIVES   The DataONE Data Stories project was created to help  “bridge  the gap between current and potential data  application”  (Rebich Hespanha, et al, 2013). In a tweet by  Hohmann, Carol Tenopir, in a presentation at the  International Association of Scientific and Technological  University Libraries’  2014  Annual Conference, said data  and stories can increase the library’s  value (2014), and  received a response by David Scherer “Agreed. We need  more narrative driven messages that can also compliment  data” (2014). Linking data stories and narratives to datasets and journal  articles in scholarly packages can increase and enhance the  value and impact of the research. The data story or narrative  can be part of supplemental information necessary for  describing and providing context for the datasets that are  analyzed in papers. Data stories and narratives:   Increase the understanding of the data, the context of the  data collection, and challenges encountered by the research  team(s).   Increase the probability of reuse and provides greater  exposure to data.   Increase the potential impact for national recognition and  tenure/promotion through additional citations.   Have instructional value for learning sound data  management practices. Evidence of value   Data stories and narratives take many forms such as those  previously described. For example, they can also be  included in supplemental materials as “expanded  explanations of methods” (Kenyon Sprague, 2014) or  “narrated short movies,” ( Howayek, et al, 2012 ). There is  evidence that linking datasets to publications increases  downloads suggesting greater impact for scholars (Zilinski,  et al, 2014). Further, linking data stories as supplemental  materials can play a role in data sharing (Kenyon Sprague,  2014) . This suggests that when linked to the publication and  dataset, these materials have the potential to increase data  sharing, reuse, and validation. DISCUSSION  Data Stories and narratives can provide context and  additional description for a dataset that other supplemental  material may not address. Both D a t a O N E  stories are written in the past tense and  were written from the point of view of an omniscient  narrator. The anecdotal tone makes it easy to read and  emphasizes the salient points. The introduction of the data  scientist’s  persona and that of the other characters make it  sound slightly artificial and the reader is left wondering if  part of the story is fiction."
A214,Data narratives: Increasing scholarly value,1,1,data stories,"However, the storytelling tone  adds a human dimension to the data stories that makes them  ring true to an audience: this enhances their instructional  value. The DataONE stories have value for teaching and  engagement with data. As noted in the “Tallying  every bug  and byte” story, a graduate student was able to retrieve, curate  and potentially re-use data. The story has the potential to  instruct graduate students the importance of data curation."
A214,Data narratives: Increasing scholarly value,1,1,data stories,"Forthcoming, DataONE will publish data stories with  discussion questions within the narrative to encourage  thoughtful conversations about data management in the  context of the story (S. Rebich Hespanha, personal  communication, May 23, 2014). The actual value of these  stories is found in their learning potential rather than for  inclusion in the scholarly package per se. These two stories illustrate different aspects of the Data  Life Cycle."
A214,Data narratives: Increasing scholarly value,1,1,data stories,"The data stories gleaned  from these publications give insight into researchers’  interactions with and management of data throughout the  data lifecycle. While perhaps not discussing a particular  dataset, although it could, these data stories have  instructional potential as well. The audience in this case is  broader than just students. Beyond students, the DCP’s can  enhance data curators’, librarians’, and IT staff’s  understanding of gaps and needs that need to be addressed  in the data lifecycle.     15508390, 2014, 1, Downloaded from https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/meet.2014.14505101088 by Hong Kong University Of, Wiley Online Library on [19/07/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License  DCPs and DataONE stories are both the products of  interviews with researchers."
A214,Data narratives: Increasing scholarly value,1,1,data story,"The ir direct applicability for  instructional purposes is limited because the human  dimension of the data story is removed by the factual  narrative. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we have presented three types of data stories ,  the DataONE stories, the Data Curation Profiles (DCP), and  the Data Descriptors from Scientific Data . Data stories are  on a spectrum from having low credibility, but inclusive of a  human dimension (DataONE), to credible, with structure and  criteria (DCP), to validated, with peer-review and dataset  deposit (Data Descriptors). We believe that data stories,  across the spectrum, are of value. There is scholarly value in  terms of providing, in a structured narrative, context and  applicable information for the reuse of data. Stories with  structure adhering to specified criteria and peer-reviewed  stories fit into this category. Stories without these  characteristics, such as the DataONE stories, add  instructional value and can be used as a learning tool in data  management."

Abstract Video clickstream data are important for understanding user be- haviors and improving online video services. Various visual ana- lytics techniques have been proposed to explore patterns in these data. However, those techniques are mainly developed for analy- sis and do not sufﬁciently support presentations."
A217,Animated Narrative Visualization for Video Clickstream Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Compared with traditional methods which directly turn click events into ani- mations, our animated narrative visualization focuses on conveying the patterns in the data to a general audience and adopts two novel designs, non-linear time mapping and foreshadowing, to make the presentation more engaging and interesting. Our non-linear time mapping method keeps the interesting parts as the focus of the an- imation while compressing the uninteresting parts as the context. The foreshadowing techniques can engage the audience and alert them to the events in the animation. Our user study indicates the effectiveness of our system and provides guidelines for the design of similar systems."

To support temporal pattern analysis, analytical visualization usually encodes “time dimension” into 2D visual displays. When data become in- creasingly complex, the design of data visualization systems tends to become too complicated. Novel visual forms, multiple linked views, hierarchical zooming, and interactions are usually used to help data analysts recognize temporal features from different per- spectives."

In 2010, Hans Rosling presented an animated bubble chart to illustrate how 200 countries developed in 200 years in 4 minutes. This revealed the story of the world’s past, present, and future development, and attracted more than 7 million views [Rosling 2009]."
A217,Animated Narrative Visualization for Video Clickstream Data,1,1,data storytelling,"Animation and Data Storytelling Animation is among the seven genres of narrative visualization summarized by Segel and Heer [Segel and Heer 2010]. Film, video, and animation form a genre of narrative visualization with which designers can show the changes in data through motion change. Readers or viewers usually need to follow the order of the ﬁlm, video or animation set by the design- ers. When presented in animation, data changes become attractive to users [Thomas et al. 1995]. Amini et al. studied more than ﬁfty professionally designed data videos to understand the structure de- signers commonly use to construct narrative visualization [Amini et al. 2015]. Recently, more and more researchers have tried to use animation to convey information and ideas. Visual sedimentation is a design metaphor that uses falling object animations, inspired by the physical process of sedimentation, to show data streams [Huron et al. 2013]. Sigovan et al. [Sigovan et al. 2013] uses an- imation to illustrate dynamic communication patterns and analyse large datasets in parallel application execution to make them easy to understand."
A217,Animated Narrative Visualization for Video Clickstream Data,1,1,data stories,"In this paper, we utilize the advantages of animation and adapt traditional narrative tactics to create more engaging animated data stories. Timeline Visualization Timeline is an effective and widely used tool to present temporal events. A well-designed timeline provides useful context and insights into temporal patterns. For example, Google News Timeline1aggregates and organizes news stories chronologically."
A217,Animated Narrative Visualization for Video Clickstream Data,1,1,data storytelling,"Making use of the visual saliency of animation, the temporal changes in data become more noticeable for the viewers. 3 Requirement Analysis Compared to exploratory interactive visualization, animated visu- alization provides a more engaging way of data storytelling. Based on the characteristics of video clickstream data, we ﬁrst analyse the requirements of the design : R1: The animated visualization should be simple enough for a general audience. The goal for the animated visualization is 1http://news.google.com/ to tell the data story and convey it to a broader audience. Thus, the visual form to encode the aggregation of clickstream data should avoid possible clutter and be easy to read. R2:The system should provide a temporal background of the data. To understand the animation and the data, viewers need the overall temporal information about the data, which can help both the data analysts and viewers understand when and why a temporal event happens. R3: The animated visualization should be able to emphasize the critical events. There might be several important moments that key events happen within the time span."
A217,Animated Narrative Visualization for Video Clickstream Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Compared with the baseline system, most participants took about half the amount of notes when using our system. 8 Conclusion We have proposed an animated narrative visualization system to present temporal video clickstream data, which enable the audience to understand data and the underlying patterns in a more engaging way. Speciﬁcally, we make use of the time remapping and fore- shadowing techniques in the ﬁlm ﬁeld. To help users build up their anticipation of the coming events, we design an animated timeline and an animated stacked graph with foreshadowing visual cues. In addition, we evaluate the system through a real world clickstream dataset."
A217,Animated Narrative Visualization for Video Clickstream Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Our work opens up new possibilities for future work in animation- based narrative visualization with data. Moreover, the animation design should not just be limited to video data. They can also be applied to general temporal data. In the future, we plan to conduct a more detailed quantitative study for different visual elements."

By integrating data with sports news, a well-design ed  data visualization is tailored towards audiences in a creative way. Through literature review and content analysis, this study will   summarize the development process of data visualization in  sports news and its characteristics, and further explore new wa ys  of sports news data visualization in this new era from the  perspectives of technology and communication. The paper  supposes this theme will be of practical importance to the  visualization research on the news report of major sports event s."

IV. DISCUSSION   A. Changes in the visualization of sports data journalism  Data journalism, or data-driven journalism, involves using  big data technology in the production of information to process   massive amounts of data within a short time, analyzing the  information filtered by big data, exploring the deep informatio n  behind the data through in-depth analysis and statistics, and  eventually presenting the data to the audience in an intuitive  and structured way."
A218,Study on China’s Visual Sports Data News in the Omni-media Era,1,1,data news,"Visualized data news with rich  visual representations and a strong sense of interaction has  grabbed the wide attention of news producers [10]. Nowadays,  the end users of sports news on the social network have long  changed their mode of thinking from text-focused to image- focused. Visual elements have become an important part of  sports news dissemination. Hence, sports news visualization is  the main way to meet the audience’s aesthetic needs."
A218,Study on China’s Visual Sports Data News in the Omni-media Era,1,1,data news,"Characteristics of sports data news visualization in China  in omni-media era  Currently, data journalism is widely used across various  media platforms at different administrative levels, including t he  national-level People’s Daily “central kitchen” news hub, as  well as county-level omni-media platforms and mobile Apps. Though news producers make data news based on the  characteristics and requirements of different media, the core  guidance behind their work is to reduce traditional word  narrative and instead use data stories to make full use of big  data and digital technologies for news communication [12]. As  for sports data news, the production falls into two categories:   First, hot sports news at the site, created by real-time analys is  through big data technology on massive sets of complicated  data collected at the match site, and delivered in an intuitive   way dedicated to reflecting the collected data; second, pre- match prediction, post-match analysis and related match  evolution, created by analysis and comparison on the big data  of previous matches, and delivered in an interactive and  entertaining visualized way which presents multidimensional  information and follows the need of sports journalism [13]. In  general, the visualization of sports data news has the followin g  four characteristics.  1) Complicated data sources  Data, as the core of sports data news, is diverse and  complicated and needs professionals to analyze. Basic sports  data includes information on the date and site of the match,  weather, athletes and the match itself. Besides these  conventional data, big data technology is used to promote  multidimensional data mining, generating diverse data like  273 Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

A218,Study on China’s Visual Sports Data News in the Omni-media Era,1,1,data news,"Instead,   the visualization of data news can present complicated data in a  vivid and intuitive way, making information more expressive  with better dissemination performance and easier for audiences  to read. Figure 4. Road map of Shanghai Marathon 2020    Figure 5. Visualized control platform for Hangzhou Marathon 2020  2) Multidimensional reports  With the support of big data technology, sports news boasts  higher possibility of data mining in terms of space and time  than other kinds of data news. This characteristic allows sport s  news producers to collect massive sets of match data in a short  time, and conduct in-depth analysis on data of previous  matches, athlete experience, site history and development of  the game. This expands the scale and scope of the report with  abundant data to illustrate multidimensional information at  every stage of the match [14-15]. For instance, we could  frequently see such news report on NBA, and below Figure 6  serves as an illustration where the news producer was able to  make the report immediately based on data of previous matches."
A218,Study on China’s Visual Sports Data News in the Omni-media Era,1,1,data news,"Sports data news visualization must be both   data-driven and narrative-driven, as narrative is a key to the  dissemination of data news. Data news visualization is more  than making graphics, and story and logic matter. To achieve  the best dissemination performance, it should make tailored  content based on interest graphs of audiences and turn varied  and complicated data into a clear story with strong narrative. Simply put, sports data news embraces enriched content  and forms thanks to the revolution of media technology, and  tends to be multidimensional, entertaining, interactive and  narrative due to the unique complicated nature of big data. Meanwhile, data visualization technology has changed and  vitalized the production and presentation of sports news. It  creates a new media environment which imperceptibly changes  how audiences view media and what they pursue, proving the  strong visual expression of sports data news.    274 Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

A218,Study on China’s Visual Sports Data News in the Omni-media Era,1,1,data news,"Limitations of sports data news on new media in China  1) Selected topics are too conventional  For reports of large-scale matches like the World Cup,  audiences vary in sports knowledge, understanding and  attention, as there may be audiences who follow the match  closely, ordinary fans passionate about uncommon knowledge  or gossip, and enthusiasts who prefer in-depth reports. Chinese   media should know their core and targeted audiences, and  design multilevel and multidimensional report topics to meet  the varied requirements of different audiences. In other words,   they should offer as many topics as possible in addition to  conventional topics, covering from in-depth analysis to  interesting uncommon knowledge, so their reports can serve as  options for more groups.  2) Contents are tedious and unfocused  S o m e  s p o r t s  n e w s  r e p o r t s  c o v e r  m a s s i v e  c o m p l i c a t e d   materials which sometimes include some less important ones. In this case, it is necessary to reduce audiences’ reading  pressure through interactive design, like putting unimportant  information in one icon with an access button."
A218,Study on China’s Visual Sports Data News in the Omni-media Era,1,1,data news,"This means that the audience can  quickly get what the report intends to deliver and what they  want to know further, even if they just have a glance.  3) Data mining is not in-depth  Though Chinese media have a lower passion about big data  at the moment, data news remains to be the mainstream. Therefore, a media platform choosing data news is like riding  the tide of the era. Meanwhile, as investigative journalism in  the Chinese market requires media workers to find a new way  to investigate and express, data news serves their requirements   well, because it is a brand-new way to report news through data   and technology. However, the commercial rationale accounts  more for the switch to data news than professional pursuit. Chinese media tend to report data news in a visualized way to  present eye-catching and easy-to-click operation; they have no  passion to explore how to utilize the data-driven way to offer  professional quantitative reports and in-depth investigations. V. CONCLUSION   The communication pattern of omni-media creates a  medium environment with high potential to integrate news  production and big data technology. The breakthroughs and  innovation of visualization technology drive the development  of sports data news, helping to present high-quality sports new s  in diverse visual ways and creating a promising future for  sports data news in the omni-media environment. Through this  research, we find that though sports data news visualization  boasts many advantages and characteristics, the current sports  data news on new media in China faces some certain  limitations. We hope future research can focus more on the  problems and provide solutions.

But how does the rise of these “programmer-journalists,” armed with their skills and technical artifacts, really affect the way journalism can contribute to the public good? Based on an empirical study in Chicago, we show in this article that although they have built on previous historical developments, these programmer-journalists have also partly challenged the epistemology conveyed by the computer-assisted reporting tradition in the US, grounded in the assumption that data can help journalists to set the political agenda through the disclosure of public issues. Involved in open source communities and open government advocacy, these programmers and their technical artifacts have conveyed challenging epistemological propositions that have been highly controversial in the journalism community."

A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Prior research has not examined the conditions by which news-papers initially decide to invest in data journalism or how newspapers choose to grow their data-driven storytelling efforts. To remedy this dearth in the literature, this study identifies four “critical junctures” of organizational restructuring connected to the integration of data journalism into American newspapers. By examining the structural forces at play, this research provides context to the shift toward data-driven news production. Structuring Newsroom Labor Within the newsroom, an organizational structure—defined as the “recurrent set of  relationships between organizational members”1—systematically arranges journalistic  labor, while also standardizing practitioner workflows.2 Ideally, an organizational  structure enhances the productivity of the workers who populate it.3 Demers opera- tionalizes corporate newspapers as an organization that exhibits a complex division of labor, a hierarchy of authority, a staff of highly skilled workers, a set [of] formal rules and procedures, and as an organization that places a great deal of emphasis on rationality in decision making. 4 On-the-job practices that partition practitioner labors are adopted by corporate  newspapers because they maximize efficiency.5 Prior literature has evidenced a cor - relation between organizational size and the organization’s level of internal specializa-tion. 6 As the organization hires more employees, these workers must specialize their  efforts.7 Within newsrooms, journalists have developed subject-level expertise to rou- tinely produce news.8 To accommodate this distribution of knowledge throughout an  organization, the structural form incorporates several layers of management.9 Within a  complex organization, the structure may be an amalgam of distinct, department-level operations that each approach managerial functions differently. 10 In short, the chal- lenge of arranging newsroom labor increases in complexity as the organization grows in size. 11 At the same time, organizations must balance between routinizing predictable tasks  and promoting greater levels of task uncertainty that drives innovation.12 News work— a non-routine set of tasks centered upon the unexpected and exceptional event—often stands at odds with work that can be easily routinized. 13 In order to perform their daily  duties, journalists must rely upon intuition, experience and personal judgment— attributes that are difficult to codify. 14 Higher levels of task uncertainty generally  translate to higher levels of complexity within the organizational structure to accom-modate ad hoc decision-making processes. 15 Organizational culture, or the “accumulated learning shared by a set of members of  an organization,” also influences structural models.16 As established by Schein’s works  430 Newspaper Research Journal 38(4) on internal change within organizations, the adoption or rejection of strategic impera- tives (including the integration of new structural forms) is largely dependent upon the shared culture. 17 While journalistic culture has been historically slow to change, news- rooms have, nevertheless, experimented with new organizational structures to accom-modate industry transitions. Examining prior shifts in journalistic practice can help inform individuals about how digital newsrooms are adapting to the latest cycle of change: the entry of data news work. Turbulence and Transition: Cycles of Newsroom  Reorganization Initial waves of newsroom restructuring can be traced to the 1830s, an era in which  American newspapers expanded in size and stature.18 Editors, who could no longer  personally handle the diversity of tasks within the newsroom, needed additional labor  to handle the growing burden of original reporting.19 The move toward increased pro- fessionalization within journalistic practice would gain further traction with the devel-opment of beats—the bureaucratic system of assigning journalists to cover stories by topic or institution. 20 While beats have persisted for decades, ancillary staff contribut- ing to the newsgathering mission—particularly those in visually oriented positions—have been traditionally managed in separate newsroom units. This cleavage between “word” and “picture” people widened with the shift toward digital publication. 21 The  transition to electronic pagination in the mid-1990s created design desks—separate, editorial departments that sought to unify the visual work of copy editors, page layout artists and graphics staff. 22 With the move toward digital news work, newsrooms of the late 1990s again exper - imented with new organizational structures. Several metropolitan dailies developed topic teams, in which editors were partnered with a half dozen reporters stretched across beats and departments. 23 In the early 2000s, journalists entered converged  newsrooms, closely collaborating to create products for both print and the web.24  Within the last decade, the newspaper industry has addressed the “crisis” of shrinking print circulation figures, resources and manpower by again turning to new technolo-gies. 25 This recent transition was not without strain, however, as journalists initially  embraced “a fear-driven defensive innovation culture,” apprehensive that new media formats would: ••act as an impediment to practice ••exacerbate existing resource deficiencies or, at the most extreme ••make human newsgathering obsolete. 26 Amid mass downsizings in the 2000s, incumbents in the newsroom had to adapt,  learning new skills.27 In the mid-2010s, newsroom practitioners are experimenting with data journalism,  the production of narratives and visualizations that harness large-scale datasets for digital storytelling. 28 An outgrowth of empirical and computational approaches to  news work, particularly computer-assisted reporting, the uptake of data journalism has accelerated as open data streams can be captured in real time. 29 To date, however,  Boyles and Meyer 431 investment in data journalism has been uneven across news organizations, with initial  research suggesting that large-scale publications—both print and digital-only—are more active in data journalism initiatives. 30 Across news organizations of all sizes,  fostering data journalism demands that organizational structures effectively partition news work."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data news,"Methods Based upon 18 in-depth interviews with data journalism leaders, this research  uncovers how American newspapers are structurally integrating data news workers into newsrooms. Within journalism studies, prior research has used interviews with practitioners to understand data news work better. 31 For this study, a pair of sampling  frames from America’s largest 100 newspapers by circulation, according to the Alliance for Audited Media and all state capital newspapers, was used to select inter - viewees. After removing duplicates, the final sample encompassed 120 daily newspa-pers. To build a snowball sample of industry practitioners, online staff directories and Twitter profiles were initially used to identify potential interviewees, who were selected based upon their formal job titles/positions or informal duties/responsibilities leadership roles for data journalism within their news organization. The interviews, which were completed from April 2015-February 2016, encompassed 16 men and two women."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data news,"The conversations—which lasted 32 minutes—focused upon institutional catalysts for initial investment in data news work, supervisory relationships within their news organizations, staffing size/perceived effectiveness and lev-els of task routinization/collaboration across the news organization. In analyzing the interview data, the researchers applied the framework of “critical  junctures,” 32 looking for pivotal decision-making points that shaped how the news  432 Newspaper Research Journal 38(4) organization invested or expanded its data journalism operations. Influenced by  grounded theory,33 researchers conducted a close reading of the interviews, identifying  conditions that led to internal newsroom restructuring. The researchers then looked for recurrent patterns across organizations."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data news,"The initial move to start data journalism operations came internally from a lone  editorial employee who championed the value of data news work to senior manage-ment. This “data advocate” was typically a middle-aged news worker, who had limited experience with computational approaches to news work. Oftentimes these practitio-ners were hobbyists – news workers who tinkered with computers outside of the news-room. Others were promising and talented employees who were invited by the organization to “re-train” in data news work by attending conferences or completing online training. Among other contributions, the “data advocate” offers to: ••continue their own independent learning/education ••retrain other newsroom employees ••produce a “test” story that would illustrate the potential of data-driven news. All interview subjects agreed that managers within the newsroom were generally  supportive of these entrepreneurial efforts. Taken together, the efforts of the “data advocate” were the primary catalyst for managers to more thoroughly examine the paper’s long-term commitment to data-driven storytelling. Integrating Data Journalism: Four Critical Junctures Building on the initial interest, data journalism integration, seen by practitioners as  the integration of datasets into storytelling, generally follows a linear path—migrating through four critical junctures or turning points at which investment in data journalism expands. Initially, newsroom managers regard data journalism as exemplary effort, in which the paper’s existing editorial employees take on data-driven stories in addition to their assigned responsibilities. At the second critical juncture, newsroom managers hire a solitary practitioner, who is assigned to data narratives full-time."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data news,"Newsroom leaders at the third critical juncture embed one or more data news workers into existing  Boyles and Meyer 433 newsroom team structures, in efforts to partner with other editorial employees. Finally,  the fourth critical juncture culminates with the news organization forming an indepen-dent data unit, in which data news workers act as a collective team. While two publica-tions in the study’s sample bypassed the series of critical junctures and directly invested in a team approach, most news organizations take an incremental approach, moving systematically through each critical juncture. Critical Juncture #1: Exemplary Effort Data journalism is initially regarded as exemplary effort, in which ambitious “data  advocates” offer their talents voluntarily to the organization. “When I first started, I was kind of my own department,” one data journalist said. 34 Structurally, the journalist  maintains his or her existing place in the organization chart and continues interfacing with a “regular” supervisor—typically the paper’s city editor. These reporters are informally tasked to maintain their assigned beats, while producing data-driven work in their “spare time.” Given the temporal pressures of producing content for their assigned beat, city desk editors rarely assign additional data stories. As a result, the reporter generally constructs data-driven narratives that connect to the reporter’s assigned beat. Working alone in the organization, these journalists reported that their learning is often stymied because colleagues in the newsroom could not teach them new approaches to data production. The narratives and visualizations produced by the “home grown” talent provide positive momentum for the news organization to invest more deeply in additional resources—mainly new, external hires."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data stories,"Critical Juncture #3: Embedded Collaboration Fueled by the solitary practitioner’s success, newsrooms contemplate further  investment in data journalism based upon sustained online metrics that demonstrate that data stories are drawing digital audiences. At the same time, solitary practitioners generally seek out collaboration with other newsroom staff. In most cases, data  434 Newspaper Research Journal 38(4) journalists locate like-minded allies in the newsroom—employees who understand the  demands, culture and computational thinking inherent in data news work. In cultivat-ing internal allies, data journalists generally gravitate toward a trio of existing news-room teams: investigation, visual and interactive units. Navigating this critical juncture, interviewees say, requires “wrangling,” “negotiat- ing” and “bargaining” with editors, who initially resist the efforts to partition the data journalist’s labor. In this case, the data journalist generally advances the argument that the move to an established team would enhance the reporter’s productivity."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data-driven news,"Critical Juncture #4: Data Unit Publications then create independent data units, with entire teams exclusively dedi- cated to data-driven news production. Interviewees report that when data operations begin gathering national recognition—either by receiving industry awards or by attracting the spotlight at national conferences—managers consider significantly expanding the paper’s commitment to data journalism. In mid-2016, only three news organizations of the 18 organizations profiled had data units. Of these newsrooms, data units varied widely in size from: ••a unit of four news workers at a mid-major metropolitan daily ••a team of a half dozen news workers at a major metropolitan daily ••an extensive sub desk of 15 editorial news workers at an elite circulation paper."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data-driven news,"Instead, interviewees provide evi-dence that data journalism reaches critical mass once senior leaders, typically publish-ers or chief executives responsible for decision-making, assert data-driven news production as an internal priority. In most cases, this process takes time to hire staff, experiment with routines and witness any return on investment that arises from data-driven narratives. Growing data journalism over time, in short, requires restructuring the newsroom. Discussion Similar to prior cycles of specialist labor who have been integrated into the news- room, the entry of data journalism has necessitated structural experimentation within corporate newspapers."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data-driven news,"In building a robust, data-driven newsroom, staffing expands beyond voluntary or soli-tary data hires. As more data journalists begin working in the organization, the news-room needs additional layers of management to handle the specialist labor. Supervision for the data unit is the most complex because these teams are structurally independent from the rest of the newsroom. Prior research has illustrated that non-routine work equates to higher degrees of  specialization within an organization."
A229,Newsrooms accommodate data-based news work,1,1,data-driven news,"As a result, as task uncertainty increases within data-driven newsrooms, data practitioners often trade beat knowledge for computational knowledge. While this study broadens our understandings of structural responses to data jour - nalism, the findings are limited by the small sample of interviewees, whose self-reported views of structural integration may not align with practice. To more fully evaluate data journalism integration, future scholarship can feature in-depth inter - views with senior executives who make the choice to grow data operations. Researchers should also more fully examine the interplay of organizational culture and organiza-tional structures in the context of data production."
A230,Data-stories about (im)patient customers in tele-queues,1,1,data stories,"Nevertheless, we have tried to touch on most of them through our data-stories, as told in the following section. (One importantomission is the impatience of customers, as it evolves through successive redials that follow either a service or an abandonment; see Khudyakov et al. [ 32] for a recent analysis.) 3 Data stories of customer impatience 3.1 Fitting patience distribution Can one observe an uncensored patience distribution? The left-hand plot in Fig. 4 summarizes the tele-waiting experience, of close to 12,000 customers of an Israeli Bank during November 24, 2008. These customers were seeking phone service from their bank’s call center, being unaware of the fact that, due to equipment malfunction,agents were unable to accept their calls. As far as we know, the customers in this call center did not hear any announcements on estimated wait, neither on regular days nor speciﬁcally on November 24, 2008."
A230,Data-stories about (im)patient customers in tele-queues,1,1,data stories,"As a ﬁnal comment, our data reveal a stochasticorder between the patience distributions of VIP versus Regular customers; but, as seen in [ 40], there is in fact an ordering between the hazard-rates for the bank account operations—Regular being above VIP—which is stronger than the order betweensurvival functions. 3.7 M/M/ n+M model validation In our previous data stories, we presented a rich spectrum of impatience patterns but without any detailed discussion on their integration into queueing model, speciﬁcally if the ultimate goal is applications of these models. Our last “story” now discusses theapplicability of Erlang-A, or M/M/ n+M, which is the most basic model that accom- modates impatience and hence abandonment. Our experience suggests that it is used by some advanced workforce management software, as a basic block of their stafﬁng engine. (Surprisingly, Erlang-C (M/M/ n) is still used by some, perhaps many, who then must become very “creative” in order to generate information about abandon-ment from their patience-ignorant model.) Consider a call center, or one of its departments, which consists of a group of (more or less) homogeneous agents, who are all dedicated to serve a homogeneouspopulation of customers. The following two questions then naturally arise: 1."

With the advent of the big data era, the production mode of news isconstantly innovating, and the data visualization technology is like an industrial revolution, which changes the traditional narrative mode, let news become products that be produced[14]. Mining depth information in fragmented unstructured data has become a key link for news media to provide infor- mation services, and thus spawned data news, or data driven news [ 15]. 3.1 The development from computer-aided reporting to data driven news Anderson points out that the basic idea of data news is not new, but could traced back to history [ 16]. From the evolu- tion of news reporting form, data news is not a new form, and it has a continuous development relationship with pre-cision news and computer aided news report [ 17]. In 1960s, American scholar and journalist Philip Meyer put forward the theory of precise journalism. Accurate news has thenature of in-depth reporting, especially in digital informa- tion. Computer aided reporting originates from the need for accurate news reporting."

Compared with the accurate news and computer-aided reports, data news reports in the sys- tem, timeliness, interactivity and reading experience havemade great progress. In addition, it also embodies the spirit of openness and sharing in the digital age. Massive data is freely accessible to users through the Internet, with advanceduser centric tools, self-publishing, and crowdsourcing tools, it makes it easier for more people to use these data to make news [ 18]. 3.2 Research on the concept of data news Data news is a new achievement that the news media industry is constantly exploring and developing with the trend of datainformation. It is a new way of news production in the era of big data. In brief, it’s data-driven reporting, speciﬁcally, by mining and displaying the relevance and model behindthe data, using the rich and interactive visual communica- tion, create a new way of news reporting.

In dynamic situations in which the flow of online information is rapid, fluid, and disordered, the process of how distributed teams construct a temporal narrative is not well understood nor well supported by information and communication technologies (ICTs). Here, we examine an intense need for temporal sensemaking: time- and safety-critical information work during the 2017 Hurricane Maria crisis response in Puerto Rico.

This research makes three contributions for the CSCW community: •Insights drawn from nine semi-structured interviews that reveal a temporal sensemaking process of triage ,evaluation ,negotiation , and synchronization across the globally distributed team members; •Creative speculation by the volunteers about how this four-stage temporal sensemaking process might be more effectively instantiated in work practice and the technologies that support the work; and •Design implications for improving commonplace, cloud-based collaboration tools to better support high-tempo information crowdwork. 2 BACKGROUND: DIGITAL HUMANITARIAN WORK 2.1 Crisis Informatics Ahumanitarian crisis is a large scale emergency caused by an environmental hazard, conflict, or public health threat that results in mass casualties, civil disruptions, property loss, and/or the sudden displacement of people from their homes [ 35,50]. As mobile phones, social media, and messaging apps have gained a foothold across the world over the last 20 years, ICTs have become an important communication channel during crises that allow people to share information, document eyewitness reports, and even call out for help when public systems fail [ 32,36]. During a single large-scale catastrophe, ICTs can contribute tens of millions of publicly-available data points."

Further, we contribute design speculations, prompted by the study participants themselves and indexed to each of the temporal sensemaking approaches. In future work, we plan to use this scaffolding to design and prototype tools for globally distributed humanitarian teams that incorporate improvements to overcome the sociotemporal disorder that is ever-present in this class of crowdwork. Our data suggest that actionable solutions in this space will need to contend with the lack of flexibility in the appropriated assemblages of existing, cloud-based collaborative sociotechnical tools that these kind of remote teams use to conduct their work. 10 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by US NSF grant IIS-1564275."

We view this as an additional resource for data curation, aimed speciﬁcally at supporting the sharing of qualitative and ethnographic data. The Data Story concept is motivated by three elements: 1. the increased attention of funding agencies and academic institutions on Research Data Management and Open Science; 2. our own work with colleagues applying ethnographic research methods; and 3. existing literature that has identiﬁed speciﬁc challenges in this context. Ongoing issues entailed in dealing with certain contextual factors that are inherent to qualitative research reveal the extent to which we still lack technical design solutions that can support meaningful curation and sharing. Data Story provides a singular way of addressing these issues by integrating traditional data curation approaches, where research data are treated as ‘objects’ to be curated and preserved according to speciﬁc standards, with a more contextual, culturally-nuanced and collaborative organizing layer that can be thought of as a “Story”. The concept draws on existing literature on data curation, digital storytelling and Critical Data Studies (CDS). As a possible design solution for Research Data Management and data curation, Data Story oﬀers: 1) a collaborative workﬂow for data curation; 2) a story-like format that can serve as an organizing principle; 3) a means of enhancing and naturalizing curation practices through storytelling. Data Story is currently being developed for deployment and evaluation.

The solution aims to support the partial curation of data by encouraging a pre- Designing a Data Story  289:3   PACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. selection of relevant data that researchers might wish to share that can then be contextualized by making use of storytelling practices. The concept grew out of a long-term engagement within an interdisciplinary Collaborative Research Centre, where we observed researchers working in interdisciplinary ethnographically-driven contexts and engaged in conversations with them about data their practices. The Data Story design can be seen as a way of building upon the current informal sharing practices we observed and of addressing the unsolved Research Data Management issues we surfaced. The Data Story, as an exploratory and conceptual design solution, has its roots in literature relating to data curation and sharing  [7, 8, 12, 55, 56]. However, it also takes inspiration from works relating to data storytelling [18, 34, 46], and Critical Data Studies [12, 13, 32]. Ethnographic and other qualitative data, historically associated with the social sciences but increasingly deployed in HCI and CSCW contexts, are inherently narrative in character. It follows that something akin to ‘storytelling’ might be an appropriate focus for the data sharing agenda. As we will be elaborating below, Data Story, as a concept, seeks to supplement traditional data curation approaches by adding a more contextual, cultural and collaborative organizing layer: “the Story”. 2 RELATED WORK There are three principal bodies of literature that delineate the research space this paper is addressed to. One of these reconstitutes data management as a sociotechnical issue and stands as a critique of approaches that assign a certain ﬁxity to what counts as data. Another focuses more speciﬁcally upon the sharing of qualitative data and the unique challenges this can pose. The third is concerned with data narratives and data storytelling and the extent to which this has already featured in approaches to data management. We look at each of these in turn below. 2.1 Critical Data Studies and the myth of ‘raw data’ As Dourish and Cruz [17] have pointed out: “Data makes sense only to the extent that we have frames for making sense of it, and the diﬀerence between a productive data analysis and a random-number generator is a narrative account of the meaningfulness of their outputs” [17, p.8]. We see this, above all, as an issue of rationale. Why is data collected, organized and represented in the way that it is?"

Beyond this, time issues may also arise because “the burden of organizing qualitative data for inspection or reuse could easily exceed the work of writing the manuscript itself” [54, p.5]. Evidently, the sharing of qualitative data is anything but trivial."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data storytelling,"As we shall see, Data Story oﬀers an innovative and lightweight way of addressing some of these complex issues. 2.3 Data Storytelling: Guiding principles and insights The social sciences and humanities have long stressed the role that narrative plays in human life, education and research. As Game and Metcalfe [25] argue: “Research is always an interpretative process that involves conversations and storytelling, though the research framework traditionally applies other names such as aims, methods and conclusions. Research conventions are a particular form of storytelling that allows sociologists and historians ‘to tell stories as if they weren’t’ storytellers’” [25, p. 65]. Social scientists tell these stories for a range of purposes."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data storytelling,"Over the last decade, the advent of big data and the data revolution [31] has led to western economies and governments becoming increasingly data-driven, leading to a growing focus speciﬁcally on ‘Data Storytelling’  [46]. The main argument is that, to understand and use ‘data’ eﬀectively, it needs to communicate a clear message (a narrative) in intelligibly human terms that enable us to make sense of it (‘data sense-making’) and understand why it looks (is reconstructed) the way it is. At heart, data storytelling consists of three main elements: 1) explaining the context; 2) identifying a coherent narrative; and 3) providing eﬀective visualization. Note, again, the emphasis upon context here, with it being the producer of the narrative who identiﬁes the relevant context. At the same time, and as with all human communication, the narrative that is produced involves assumptions about its potential audience, which, in turn, recognizes the second active principle in data storytelling, i.e., narration. A narrative can stimulate learning, emotions, and drive action through discursive constructions. A story has a beginning and an end, it has a goal, sometimes a moral, and, as already mentioned, an audience that it is designed to engage. The power of narrative can help to share norms and values, develop trust and commitment, share tacit knowledge, facilitate unlearning, and generate emotional connections [52]."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data storytelling,"To conclude, relatively little attention has been paid to data storytelling for design purposes and even less to its use in the construction and reconstruction of qualitative data for the purposes of data curation and sharing. We will be arguing here that the concept of a Data Story is particularly appropriate when making sense of qualitative research data. Storytelling can thus be used as an organizing principle when curating and sharing excerpts (snippets) of data from heterogenous data collections to facilitate its contextualization. 3 BACKGROUND AND APPROACH As background to the Data Story, this section details the ﬁeldwork and practical experience of working within a research infrastructure project (INF) that together guided its conceptualization and design. The project INF is connected to a Collaborative Research Center (CRC) that started in January 2016 and is still ongoing. The ﬁeldwork was characterized by an ethnographic approach and comprised observations and semi-structured interviews, as well as long-term engagement and member participation. Interdisciplinary discussions concerning Research Data Management and data practices within CRC’s projects took place regularly in the CRC and the principal author’s involvement in these provided an opportunity for numerous formal and informal conversations with researchers."

A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"The Data Story concept was grounded in this apparent need. From it we came to see that the showcasing of data ‘snippets’ and the integration of storytelling practices could potentially support the organization, curation and eventually the sharing of research data, in greater synergies with the researchers’ practices. Fig. 1 – The first sketch of the Data Story idea, generated during a meeting in July 2019. The ﬁrst outline of the Data Story idea arose as a sketch2 during a group meeting in July 2019 (Figure 1). It was inspired by the way that researchers were seen to share data snippets and engage with them on an ad hoc basis during internal meetings. This partial and purposeful sharing was the point of departure. We returned to it and developed the idea further by designing a low-ﬁdelity prototype between January and March 2021."

We will report on own our observations and related issues in the next section. 4 EMPIRICAL INSIGHTS 4.1 Data sharing: Informal practices and workarounds Most CRC projects involve two or more disciplines working together, typically social scientists, anthropologists or media scholars working with computer scientists, designers and/or software developers. Methods for data collection are heterogeneous, often local to the disciplines involved."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"Based on these observations, Data Story started to emerge as a solution that researchers could engage with at any stage of a project in order to represent snippets of heterogenous research data, engage in discussion concerning data interpretations and develop bottom-up curation standards. What we particularly took from the above is the fact that there are already mechanisms that qualitative researchers have in place for sharing data. However, what does not happen is the sharing of all of the data all at once, if ever. Rather facets of their data are shared, having been pre-treated in certain ways, and those facets are embedded in narrative structures that premise   Designing a Data Story  289:11   PACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. the data in certain ways, according to its expected recipients, just as stories are shaped for their anticipated audience in certain ways. Another key observation was that qualitative researchers currently struggle to ﬁnd consistent ways of doing this, but rather adopt formats, structures and platforms in a piecemeal fashion according to whatever currently seems to be at-hand. Data Story, as a concept, focuses on this nodal point, between the data and those with whom it might be shared. It is not an end-to-end solution, but it seeks to draw upon what already happens naturally and to imbue it with more structure and to make it more conducive to meeting some of the more formal demands associated with the Research Data Management agenda. Thus, it might be seen as a way of facilitating the readier sharing of qualitative research data than is currently the case. In the next section, we explore how Research Data Management, as it stands, is seen primarily as a source of tension. 4.1 Research Data Management issues When the CRC started its “ﬁrst phase” in January 2016, not all projects were fully aware of the DFG agenda relating to the long-term preservation and accessibility of data that would imply commitment on their part to share data."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"Data Story was therefore also focused upon providing such tools to support both ongoing and completed research. In particular, we envisaged an interactive interface that could present their data for comparative purposes, allow for intermediate feedback, promote the ongoing evolution of research data, and potentially provide an alternative publication format. 5 THE ‘DATA STORY’ CONCEPT AND ITS DESIGN The preceding materials provide a backdrop to the development of the Data Story concept and its design. This concept takes the notion of a ‘story’ as a design metaphor and uses it as a source of inspiration for the representation, organization and description of partial and situated research data to be shared with colleagues, and/or with external audiences. As mentioned above, it is not an end-to-end solution. Instead, it takes existing practices, concerns and requirements as a point of departure and seeks to facilitate the establishment of curation and sharing practices."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"Above we noted that we recurrently observed  Designing a Data Story  289:13   PACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. researchers telling stories about their data, but in a relatively unstructured way. Our design seeks to give more structure to that practice, while aﬀording other aspects of the data curation process that meet researchers recorded wishes. The concept draws on all three aﬀordances of data storytelling identiﬁed in the literature by providing: a) a way to contextualize collected data; b) a narrative structure to demonstrate its analytical potential, c) a vehicle for the integration of additional representational elements. We discuss below how ‘Data Story’ was envisaged in accordance with these principles. It should be emphasized that Data Story has not yet been deployed and evaluated. To date, we have only developed a low-ﬁdelity prototype4. Therefore, at present, it only has the status of being a conceptual design, albeit grounded in our empirical work. We plan to implement this design in the up-and-coming months as an independent module in an existing and established platform called ‘Research-hub’, which is built for team collaboration and sharing and that is already used by multiple research groups in our university. 5.1 Research-hub ‘Research-hub’ is a customized platform based on Humhub open source software for team communication and collaboration (see https://www.humhub.com/en)."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"We intend to develop Data Story as a module that will be connected to the User and Space levels (i.e., smaller collaborative units). Certain outputs - once published - will also be displayed at a Community level for broader sharing within the institution. Hanging Data Story oﬀ of Research-hub facilitates easy cross-discipline, cross-project and cross-department sharing. This reﬂects the existing character of many meetings within which data-sharing takes place. It also stands as an example of what the Open Data agenda might be seen to be about, but in miniature. 5.2 Data Story Design in a nutshell Data Story provides a preliminary structure or template to help researchers organize and describe the context of a speciﬁc study by making use of written narratives (stories). The interface is organized into chapters, so that shared data can be sorted into sections, aiding navigation through the story. The sequential organization of the chapters creates a timeline of actions, events, and decisions regarding the study being shared. Each chapter might contain multiple documents and ‘data snippets’ that help to clarify the overall story."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. to connect a Data Story with a speciﬁc researcher or research team (so as to be publicly acknowledged and possibly contacted). Fig. 3 – Example of a Data Story structure: chapters’ overview and related metadata. To exemplify the possibilities, we provide a possible structure for three diﬀerent chapters within a Data Story (see Figure 3): (1) project set-up; (2) data processing (with snippets of anonymized data); (3) main ﬁndings. Each chapter provides a focused insight into the study conducted and suggests a narrative structure threaded through the chapters. There is some general information regarding the story that is provided in the overview screen. This can give information about the time frame and the project to which it belongs (a single publication, a complete research project, a PhD dissertation, etc.)."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"Across the chapters, authors are encouraged to enrich the Data Story with various kinds of contextual information that echoes many of the practices we observed during our own ﬁeldwork, where not just pre-selected data was made available to prospective meeting attendees, but also information about it, such as when and where it was collected, the informants, etc. This can serve to overcome a number of the issues we identiﬁed, such as the fact that data snippets are not currently provided in ways that make them searchable, easy to export to continue analytic work, or open to broader sharing or re-use. It also oversteps many of the current concerns being expressed about metadata and documentation by providing a natural way for this to be embedded in the preparation of data for sharing that respects its potential heterogeneity.  5.2.1 The project set-up chapter. The project set-up chapter introduces the overall story outline, thus providing an understandable context for the study."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"In this chapter, researchers   Designing a Data Story  289:15   PACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. who write the story are encouraged to consider the following questions (and include their answers in their story narrative): • How does your story start and where is it situated?  • What is the topic of the story? • What is/are the research question(s)? • Why are you sharing the story? What is the goal? • For whom would this story/study be interesting?  • Who would be interested in your data?  5.2.2 The data processing chapter. The ‘data processing’ chapter encapsulates the actual ‘data snippets’."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"This feature of Data Story took inspiration from, and is actively designed to reﬂect existing practices. We saw how data was pre-selected from larger datasets to illustrate putatively important themes, in a way that could support collaborative interpretation, discussion, and the development of further ideas. It also avoids a need for researchers to proceed in radically diﬀerent ways because they are already investing eﬀort in the pre-selection of the most relevant data to support their interactions with other researchers. One of the key advantages to proceeding in this way is that it may serve to eliminate the current tendency for data snippets to be spread across disparate platforms and ﬁle-sharing systems without any consistency of structure."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"Data Story supports the sharing of diﬀerent data formats. Some snippets might be extracted from a text ﬁle and have a text format, e.g. interview questions, transcripts, notes, etc. Other data snippets might take the shape of audio or video ﬁles, presentations, posters, pictures, sketches and design materials, etc. All of this can be seen to reﬂect a need to support existing heterogeneous data collection practices with a variety of data formats."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"Again, guiding questions and tips are visible upfront to help researchers structure the information and narrative, e.g.:  • What ﬁndings came out of your data? • To whom/in which ﬁelds is this data story speciﬁcally useful?  • Bring the story to an end.  5.3 Integrating metadata standards In general, Data Story gives the option to annotate, tag and add metadata to every chapter. Keywords and relevant tags can be assigned to both the story in general and to individual chapters. This provides a quick overview of the general context and topic of the story. Data Story suggests few basic metadata (i.e.: the Dublin Core or DDI) as a standard source for elements. They can, however, be edited quickly and/or a new folksonomy can be created to explain the data. As mentioned earlier, Data Story invests eﬀort in bringing the data and its metadata together by integrating many of the important metadata ﬁelds in its interface. This makes metadata an important pillar of the narrative and a driver of discussions. It promotes ‘data literacy’ and   Designing a Data Story  289:17   PACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. ‘awareness’ by providing an opportunity for researchers to learn about and reﬂect on the role of metadata and ﬁnally adapt it to their needs. We also envision that the metadata elements will change depending on the data type: i.e., some will be suggested for interview snippets, but diﬀerent ones for ethnographic notes, focus groups, design sketches, etc. Further research is needed to identify just which elements best match diﬀerent data types. 5.4 Supporting processual workflows: plugin solution Data Stories can be posted with key data and story milestones at any time throughout the course of a study. In fact, Data Story aims to promote ongoing curation activities as a feature of everyday workﬂows. To achieve this, Data Story will be connected to routinely-used tools for collecting, analyzing and processing data. We therefore envision a plugin solution. The plugin can be connected to text-editing software like Microsoft Word, data analysis tools like MaxQDA, literature management tools like Citavi, cloud storage tools like Sciebo5, etc. The idea is to provide researchers with an opportunity to feed their Data Stories with new input at all times by creating direct connections between Research-hub and their own data stores. In this way, researchers can select key segments (text, ﬁles, etc.) while organizing and analyzing their data and send them to a Data Story as ‘data snippets’. They will also be able to add annotations, descriptions, comments, and metadata that clarify the context of the chosen data. The transferred data snippets can be previewed and further annotated in Research-hub. They will be located in the data processing chapter unless directed otherwise."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data stories,"In this ways, Data Stories can be assembled piece by piece as a natural extension of researcher's own data processing workﬂows, instead of trying to organize the data at the end of a study. This has a better ﬁt with existing approaches where it is important to allow for interpretation, reﬂection and documentation to continually be enriched throughout the research process. 5.5 Publishing: DOI and accessibility rights Once researchers have completed a Data Story and feel secure with the provided data and narrative, they will be able to publish it. Once published, the story will be visualized in the respective community. A DOI (Digital Object Identiﬁer) can also be automatically assigned to the Data Story. A Data Story’s DOI can also be promoted in papers, so that potential collaborators or interested parties can see additional data. Individual sharable links will also be automatically generated for single data entries so that researchers can give others direct access to a speciﬁc data snippet. It is up to authors to decide the amount of data to include in a Data Story. Some authors may decide to share very small snippets, others more substantial chunks. Critically, they can also decide what to share with whom. They can share certain parts with some recipients and other parts with some other audience, all within the same Data Story. This is facilitated by having diﬀerent accessibility rights provided in the Data Story for each data snippet added to the storyline. Data Story will be accessible within the existing Research-hub platform via a web browser. By integrating it into this platform, it will be possible to engage in discussion (if desired) with people interested in the data. All in all, Data Story hopes to trigger collaborative discussion, negotiation, awareness, sense-making and reﬂexivity around shared data by whichever parties have an interest, thus neatly tying it into the Open Science agenda.                                                              5 Info on Sciebo: https://hochschulcloud.nrw/en/index.html   289:18  Gaia Mosconi et al. PACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. 6 DISCUSSION Above, we have described an approach, inspired by storytelling insights and designed to support a collaborative workﬂow for the curation and sharing of data which can be used in conjunction with more standard approaches and data descriptions. We have shown how we might, in this way, address some of the more problematic aspects of Research Data Management and how to meet the expectations of the Open Science agenda."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"First, we consider how Data Story can serve to articulate a RDM-related collaborative workﬂow. We then look at the speciﬁc advantages of promoting the notion of a ‘story’ as an organizing principle. We conclude by reﬂecting upon how Data Story, while not necessarily reducing the overhead of data management, can play an important role in naturalizing the RDM process. 6.1 Data Curation as collaborative workflow In our ﬁeldwork, we have noted how the curation and sharing practices implicit in the Open Science agenda are currently not yet visible or are only being performed in very haphazard ways. At the same time, however, we have seen that there is actually a willingness to share data amongst qualitative researchers we engaged with and, in particular, an interest in how to undertake collaborative work around their data. Data Story actively evolved out of our observations as a potential solution to manage evident RDM issues, to do that in ways that resonate with existing concerns, interests and practices, but, at the same time, to bring qualitative data curation closer to what is increasingly being demanded by funding bodies. While Data Story is not intended to oﬀer a comprehensive RDM solution, it does view RDM and data curation as a process to be embedded in daily practices within a collaborative workﬂow. In fact, current tools are not yet interconnected in a workﬂow and miss to oﬀer the opportunity to engage with curation elements such as adding metadata and annotations ‘on the go’. Data Story integrates those missing elements but also provides a ‘mechanism for narration’ with an interactive interface that helps researchers to contextualize and organize their own data with written narratives, a practice more aligned with their way of doing research and dealing with data. Composing Data Stories will still be time consuming for researchers and curation practices will remain an overhead, however, we hope researchers will have the opportunity to gain personal beneﬁts such as organizing heterogeneous data but also structuring relevant ﬁndings and analytical reﬂections to be used in collaborative discussions, publications and future work. As Birnholtz and Bietz (2003) have already suggested, to get more eﬀective data sharing systems, designers and IT developers need to go beyond current metadata models and take into account social interactions around data abstractions. Data Story takes this recommendation seriously and stresses the collaborative and social dimensions inherent in data and data practices. At this stage, we cannot yet anticipate how the narrative work will actually play out in practices, which diﬃculties researchers will encounter in engaging with its workﬂow and with whom Data Stories will actually be shared. However, we believe that a system like this would be a ﬁrst attempt to bring the invisible data work to the forefront, to embrace the diﬃculty of making curation activities ‘ﬁt’ the realities of local practices and the contingent nature of sharing practices. In this sense, Data Story promotes data awareness and reﬂexivity, and involves making curation activities and their concerns, technicalities, and speciﬁcities visible, while articulating workﬂows and processes that encourage social interaction and collaboration around data. An important part of how this will be accomplished is the embedding of Data Story within an existing platform, ‘Research-hub’, that is already purposed for communication, collaboration and sharing across a  Designing a Data Story  289:19   PACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. diverse set of research groups and disciplinary interests. Data curation and sharing practices are, in a sense, a new concern for some academic groups. As such, the concern has yet to be consolidated and supported by collaborative tools."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"Data Story is an attempt to address all these issues within the CSCW research tradition and its core themes [9]. 6.2 The story as organizing principle The practice of storytelling invites data handlers to think about their data in a way that encourages data reﬂexivity. Reﬂexivity has a special status in HSS disciplines, where there is a particular focus upon the relationship between researchers and their data. Through the organization of data snippets as data stories, researchers are speciﬁcally invited to reﬂect upon: 1) what they are sharing (i.e.: what are data, what are metadata etc., what methods were applied, etc.); 2) who they are sharing with; 3) why they are sharing in the ﬁrst place; and 4) how the data’s recipients might understand it. As our ﬁeldwork highlighted, reﬂexivity is not typically prompted by standard approaches to data curation due the technical and generic language in which metadata standards are normally expressed. Therefore, with Data Story we wish to support data sharing practices while at the same time encouraging greater reﬂexivity during the process of curation and sharing. We envision how Data Stories can be seen as a potential solution to the challenges outlined in section 4.2 by accompanying the self-archiving process. Writing a Data Story could be seen as a ﬁrst step prior to depositing the data into an oﬃcial archive. The storytelling approach is not intended to replace data curation activities or data curators. Instead, Data Story can enhance the curation process by opening up the ‘black box’ of research and providing the cultural and contextual circumstances in which data are generated, enabling this to happen during the research process, before formally archiving the data. It can ﬁt organically between the moment of data production and its formal archiving, acting as an interface that can meet the practical issues researchers are currently confronting. As indicated in the empirical insights (section 4.1), researchers already tell stories about their data in their everyday work and undertake some of the activities encompassed within Data Story. Data Story takes those existing practices and concretizes their formulation and pursuit within a visible narrative. It also facilitates the sharing of those everyday stories about data across larger cohorts of researchers. In research about situated storytelling practices [51], much is made of how storytelling provides a mechanism for the sharing of experience. There is a sense in which Data Story builds upon that sentiment by recognizing the power stories have to promote sharing and engagement. The same research also emphasizes how storytelling practices require mundane competences that most people engage in willingly. It doesn’t prevent data management and curation from being work, but it does make that work more familiar and routine. Longer term, our approach will be suitable for data reuse."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"The central question in this respect is, how does Data Story provide a narrative that not only contextualizes the production of data but also renders it relevant for those who might use it. There is no simple answer to this question, for the value of data in reuse depends as much on the reasons for reuse as it does on the reasons for its production. Nevertheless, Data Story can do a number of useful things as its chapters’ structure aﬀords certain data relevancies: the project set-up can tell re-users why the data exists  289:20  Gaia Mosconi et al. PACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 289, Publication date: November 2022. in the ﬁrst place, its potential value in relation to existing knowledge, and information about the disciplinary origins of researchers; the data processing and the ‘snippets’ can answer some of the queries re-users may have about the methods adopted, the amount of data and its format and give examples of the data, etc.; the ﬁndings can provide a link between snippets and results, enable judgements about accuracy, reliability and validity to be made, reveal literature deemed to be relevant, point to reviews of the work, suggest options for future progress. Finally, the overall narrative positions both data creators and potential re-users as active agents in the construction of meaningful data."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data storytelling,"Data Story aims to foster exchange around data storytelling that can serve as medium to explore data sense making, support data awareness and reﬂexivity. Although we have focused here upon qualitative data, the concept is, in principle, agnostic as to what is deemed to count as data. Instead, it is able to embrace a plurality of data practices and approaches. Data Story drew upon insights from CSCW, Critical Data Studies and related disciplines. These emphasize the sociality of work practices and the co-construction of meaning. Through Data Story, we want to promote more inclusive data practices that embrace a broader audience and provide diverse and faceted entry points for personal explorations. Our wish is to promote a smooth transition toward open science principles while remaining “as open as possible and as closed as necessary” [20]. At present, Data Story remains a conceptual contribution - it has not yet been deployed or evaluated. However, we plan to develop the work further by implementing and evaluating it across a range of projects. In this way, we hope to reﬁne the concept and to gain deeper insights into how it might best support researchers and the recipients of their data. Clearly, we cannot wholly predict what the outcomes of this process might be, though we can speculate."
A242,"Designing a Data Story: A Storytelling Approach to Curation, Sharing and Data Reuse in Support of Ethnographically-Driven Research",1,1,data story,"Such a view, we would argue, is fundamental to the CSCW tradition and we would encourage researchers in the ﬁeld to use the Data Story concept we have presented here as a starting point for examining how alternative approaches to data sharing and reuse can be developed. How data is socially constructed, and how the stories researchers naturally tell about their data feed into its subsequent sharing, reuse and appropriation, should be a fertile ﬁeld for CSCW research and may have much to oﬀer in turn about eﬀective data design.

A243,Vizdat: A Technology Probe to Understand the Space of Discussion Around Data Visualization on Reddit,1,1,data stories,"Prior studies of discussion around visualizations identified key areas of challenge: •Visualization authors who receive a large number of comments on their data stories need ways to manage the comments and incorporate valuable feedback into their design process [24]. •Users usually discuss one viewpoint of the data set that the author shared and would like more flexibility to explore other views within the discussion context [27]. •Users on social media are presented with a huge number of misleading charts, and there must be a way to identify and fix those charts [13–15, 18, 35]. •While user engagement level varies when interacting with charts[ 33], higher and more valuable levels of engagement are rare on discussion forums [34]. •Users prefer general and established discussion communities to share their charts. Visualiza- tion workflows should support that decentralized model [17]. We hypothesize that improving the current discussion affordances on general social media websites and forums does help in solving the challenges mentioned above. We speculate that enabling users to embed charts in their comments that could easily be modified in-situ and shared within the context of discussion will create a new space of valuable conversations."

A244,New Way of News Dissemination Based on Big Data Analysis and Visualization Technology,1,1,data news,"Restrictions apply.  reporters, obtain materials through news and news on-site research, and organize them into first-hand information.Data journalism is that journalists receive original data fromdifferent channels, and the information comes from differentsources; in terms of information analysis, traditional news ismainly based on the news knowledge obtained by reporters in interviews, while data journalism introduces related technologies for comprehensive data analysis. (1) Data collection The acquisition and collection of data is the beginning of data news production and directly affects the final result [5]. To ensure the authenticity and accuracy of data news, datacollection should be as complete and effective as possible. Interms of data volume, the data receiving channel should beexpanded as much as possible. From the perspective of dataquality, data sources should have clear sources, and dataproviders should be effective and reliable. (2) Data analysis Data analysis is an important part of data news production. The data themselves are not important, their value only begins to emerge when they are fully explained.Data analysis can conduct horizontal and verticalcomparison of data and data overlay through one-dimensional and multi-dimensional data, mining data fromdifferent angles, and deepening news value [6]. One-dimensional analysis of data is relatively simple and canonly reflect some things. The combination of multi-dimensional comparisons between data can reflect theoverall state of affairs. (3) Visual presentation Visualization is the ultimate production link of data news and the ultimate way of presenting data news. Data collection and analysis is the preparatory stage for datavisualization, which will eventually be presented throughvisualization. Visualization includes various charts, and wecan classify them into static infographics and dynamicinfographics according to the degree of interaction of datanews visualizations [7-8]. Currently, news visualization canbe achieved through open source software tools, i.e.interactive graphic production using Google chart, Googlemap, Tableau Sportfire."
A244,New Way of News Dissemination Based on Big Data Analysis and Visualization Technology,1,1,data news,"New Ways of News Dissemination In the way of news dissemination, data news visualization has experienced a series of changes from news text to news format. In terms of news text, data news is no longer dominated by linear text information, and data hasbecome the main narrative language; in terms of newsformat, news information is imaged to form visualcommunication; in terms of audience perception, audiencesare no longer passive recipients of information, the reallinkage between its interactive participation and newsformation [9]. (1) Data narrative As far as news texts are concerned, visual news reporting has completely changed the previous text-based reporting methods. Data is no longer a foil for the article, but animportant narrative statement. In regular news reports, the media is expressed based on understanding the syntactic and semantic structure of the text, and ""5W+1H"" is considered asa classic media writing mode. In terms of logicalarchitecture, data and information media have no fixedfunctions, and the logical relationship between data andinformation can be projected from different dimensions andvisual designs, which is a great challenge to the creativeability and technical level of creators."
A244,New Way of News Dissemination Based on Big Data Analysis and Visualization Technology,1,1,data news,"For your favorite data news, you can freely promote iton social media, actually participate in the production anddissemination of news, and achieve a two-way connectionwith news. This kind of interaction has greatly enhanced thepublic's sense of participation in news, and has gotten rid ofthe previous role of passively receiving information. C. Development Trend of News Communication under Data News Visualization (1)Data and Text Fusion The advantage of data and text fusion data visualization lies in appearance, such as the appearance of news points, event process, correlation, etc., while the advantage of text ismore in interpretation, including causal analysis anddifferentiated interpretation, complex situations and eventdetails. Description [12-13]. Data journalism fully values thebenefits of data visualization, but inevitably leads to a lackof causal analysis and historical detail. To this end, datajournalism can make up for this shortfall by enhancing themerging of data and text."

(3) Increased predictive reporting Although the visualization of data news is not good at expressing the scene and specific story details, it can analyze and present data, so that the public can understand thedevelopment trend and laws of things from a macroperspective [17-18]. Interpreting relevance is the power ofvisual reference. With the introduction of big data analysis,the correlation of data in various indicators and dimensionsenables us to discover the connections between things,thereby further summarizing certain trends and laws ofevents. In the past, such predictions were mainly based onthe author's subjective experience and professionalism, butthe big data analysis technology of data journalism makes the process of guessing more scientific, thus making the conclusion more accurate."

A248,The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction and Development,1,1,data story,"The ﬁrst model involves direct narrative by a speaker using visualization software to tell a data story, while the second model involves constructing a story by interactively exploring the visualization software. We used an open-ended questionnaire in a controlled lab- oratory settings in which the primary goal was to collect a number of written data stories derived from the two models. The participants’ data stories and answers were all analysed and coded using a number of themes, includ- ing insight types, and narrative structures. Our ﬁndings show that while the delivery model does not signiﬁcantly affect how easy or difﬁcult the participants found telling a data story to be, it does have an effect on the tendency to identify and use outliers insights in the data story if they are not distracted from this by direct narration, and on the narrative structure and depth of the data story. Our approach to data analysis and different storytelling axes can be usefully applied to other studies and comparisons of storytelling approaches. Categories and Subject Descriptors (according to ACM CCS) : H.5.m [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Miscellaneous— 1 Introduction Storytelling has been a common method of communication for a long time. Many scholars have demonstrated the power of storytelling as a means of information transfer [GP01] [TKB06]."
A248,The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction and Development,1,1,data stories,"In this study, we conducted a between-subject experiment using two different models of information visualization delivery to empirically examine how non-expert general users understand, construct and tell data stories. The ﬁrst model involves watching a video in which a speaker tells a data story using information visualization software, while the second model lets users in- teractively explore the data using visualization software. Although good studies have been conducted on storytelling cThe Eurographics Association 2014. Donia Badawood & Jo Wood / The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction in information visualization, the majority of these studies are designed as case studies or theoretical arguments [HD11] [SH10] [KM13]. The main contribution of this paper is that it takes the work done in this area a step further by provid- ing empirical results on the effect of the manner in which stories are delivered."
A248,The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction and Development,1,1,data story,"The study poses several questions about the audience’s and users’ con- structed, written narratives such as: What types of insights do they gain/select to tell a story? How do they structure their constructed stories? How easy or difﬁcult did they ﬁnd telling a data story to be after experimenting each delivery model? 2 The Experiment 2.1 Experimental Factors and Questionnaire Tasks The aim of this study is to explore and compare the effects of two different information visualization delivery models on people-constructed narratives. The InfoVis software we used to explore this was Gapminder [Gap]. This animated bubble chart includes x- and y-axes that allow user-selected variables to be compared, and the bubbles represent coun- tries. These bubbles are coloured by continent, and an ani- mation and/or timeline slider can be used to show how the bubbles move over time."

For this model, we chose a video by Hans Rosling using Gapminder software to give a talk [Ros08]. Rosling’s mode of storytelling with information visualization is one of the most famous in the ﬁeld. He used Gapminder’s animated bubble chart to give talks on several topics."

For this model, we used Gapminder World software [Gap] and let the participants explore the same dataset on child mortality. Participants were required to answer ﬁve questions after watching the video (narrative model) and ﬁve equivalent questions after exploring the data on Gapminder (software model). As we are not measuring the usability of the deliv- ery models, measures such as time and accuracy would not be appropriate; instead, we are interested in how each model affects users in constructing narratives and telling data sto- ries."
A248,The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction and Development,1,1,data stories,"Moreover, open-ended questions in which participants tell data stories in writing help them formulate their mental models aboutthe story and produce unitary narratives [NSD11]. This is in contrast to think-aloud techniques used in insight-based evaluation, which generates a series of insights gained in the order they were discovered [Nor06] [NSD11]. The main question, Q2, was asked to trigger the re-telling of a story. Re-telling is a widely used task in education to assess com- prehension [FNHM09]."

(Approx. 2-3 min) ﬁndings from answers to the main question used in the ex- periment: Q2 (re-telling the data story). Qualitative coding was processed as follows. We coded the data iteratively un- til generating all themes/codes. After maintaining all themes and categories and coding the data, a codebook was created."
A248,The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction and Development,1,1,data story,"The revised codebook was then used to code the rest of the data. 3.1 Q2: Re-Telling the Data Story In our analysis of the answers to this question, participants’ stories were coded based on two themes: Insight Type and Narrative Structure . 3.1.1 Insight Type Theme When analysing the participants’ stories based on this theme, we were inspired by insight-based evaluation [Nor06] [NSD11] [Nor05]. However, we only identiﬁed the insight types reported by each participant but did not quantify their number, as it is difﬁcult to count insight occurrences in writ- ten stories where a sentence may contain more than one in- sight type. The insight types that emerged and were used in coding the data based on the Insight Type theme were as follows. General Pattern: the general trend or pattern of most countries.Outlier: maximum, minimum or anything outside of the general pattern; in other words, an exception. Trade-Off: a combination of minimum and maximum or making comparisons between most and least in terms of one or more speciﬁc factors. Grouping: to group different things in one category based on one or more speciﬁc criteria. In other words, deﬁne a subset or category of data. Detailed Pattern: description of details on speciﬁc points of time or instances in general patterns. 3.1.2 Narrative Structure Theme The second theme used to analyse Q2 answers was the nar- rative structure."
A248,The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction and Development,1,1,data stories,"Then, we tested a number of hy- potheses as shown in sub-sections 4.1 to 4.3 using Fisher’s exact test (an alternative to c2for small samples). 4.1 Insight Types Reported/Used in Data Stories Figure 2: The number of participants who reported each insight type in their stories for each delivery model A summary of the insight types gained and used in the participants’ stories constructed with each delivery model is shown in Figure 2. We noticed that seven participants out of the 16 who used the software model reported an outlier insight in their stories, while the whole group who used the narrative model did not report any outliers. So, we tested the following hypothesis: H1: The InfoVis delivery model has an effect on the existence of outlier insights in the participants’ stories. We found that the difference between the two delivery mod- els in terms of the use of outlier insights in the participants’ stories is very statistically signiﬁcant (Fisher’s exact test two-tailed p-value=0.0068). 4.2 Narrative Structure: Sequencing Story Events Generally, the most common narrative structure in the par- ticipants’ stories in both delivery models was the General-to- speciﬁc structure."
A248,The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction and Development,1,1,data story,"Furthermore, it can be argued that both the Problem-Solution and Cause-and-Effect structures provide more depth to the data story than other structures. They in- volve going beyond simple correlation between x and y-axes to either explain causes for speciﬁc patterns or discuss the problem and suggest solutions. So, after qualitatively coding the data, the following hypothesis was generated: H2: There is an association between the InfoVis deliverymodel and the use of a Problem-Solution and/or Cause- and-Effect narrative structures (either as main or sub- structures). We found that 13 out of the 16 participants who used the nar- rative model used the Problem-Solution and/or Cause-and- Effect narrative structures in their stories, while only three out of the 16 who used the software model used these struc- tures in their stories."
A248,The Effect of Information Visualization Delivery on Narrative Construction and Development,1,1,data story,"The association between the delivery model and the existence of these two structures is consid- ered to be very statistically signiﬁcant (Fisher’s exact test two-tailed p-value=0.0011). 4.3 Difﬁculty of Telling a Data Story It can be thought that re-telling a data story after it is narrated by a speaker is certainly easier than constructing narratives as a result of interactive exploration of the visualization soft- ware. We tested the following hypothesis to prove that it is not that one delivery model makes it easier or more difﬁcult to tell a data story; rather, it is how the delivery model may guide the audience’s attention in a way that could affect the data story people get. H3: The InfoVis delivery model has an impact on the level of difﬁculty of telling a data story. A statistical test showed that the level of difﬁculty of telling a data story was not signiﬁcantly affected by which delivery model the participants used (Fisher’s exact test two-tailed p- value=0.48). 5 Conclusion and Discussion Outlier insight was used more often by the participants who constructed data stories by exploring the data in Gapminder. The fact that outliers caught the audiences’ attention is im- portant, particularly in the absence of a narrator who directs the audience’s attention to the desired events. The danger in this approach is that outliers, by deﬁnition, are not represen- tative of the data as a whole, so care is needed to lead users from attention-grabbing outliers to the core message implied by the data. As it is more likely that participants will use a Problem- Solution or Cause-and-Effect narrative structure with the narrative model, one should pay special attention to these kind of details/depth in the absence of a narrator who can justify, explain, or provide background information."

Thus, it is debatable whether reader- driven stories belong to narrative visualization, since the authorcannot ensure that a message is conveyed if the user has consid- erable freedom in what to look at. Interactive visualizations lie be- tween these two orientations, combining and balancing aspects of both. A structured narrative is supported by limited interactive ele- ments.

A252,HydrogenAR: Interactive Data-Driven Presentation of Dispenser Reliability,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Our work with HydrogenAR foregrounds opportunities for innovating presentation delivery in AR using novel, engaging presentation formats. 2R ELATED WORK Our approach the explores the beneﬁts of using immersive AR for presentations in prior research, considering AR for tours and education, data-driven storytelling, and use of AR for information visualization. 2.1 AR Tours & Educational Presentations Previous literature has used AR to situate virtual content in the envi- ronment for education. For example, systems have utilized AR to reveal the underlying processes in circuits to students [2]. Surgeons can perform a simulated surgery [45] or receive guidance from a remote instructor in a real operation [5]. Garz ´on et al. provide a systematic review and analysis of 61 AR educational studies from 2012 to 2018 and found that AR can increase student motivation [12]."
A252,HydrogenAR: Interactive Data-Driven Presentation of Dispenser Reliability,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"We build on this work by considering UI design for both the presenter and the audience and how physical infrastructure and situated visualizations can ﬁt into the presentation design. 2.2 Data-Driven Storytelling Data-driven storytelling combines visualizations with narratives to facilitate exploration and communicate information from data analyses [4, 22, 38, 44]. News organizations like the New Y ork Times and The Economist regularly publish articles that incorporate interactive data visualizations (e.g., Rich et al. [36]). Data journalists have also been early adopters of AR [31], including through web articles [42] designed to be used with AR head-mounted displays. However, there are fewer examples of data-driven storytelling for science and engineering generally [27]. A recent survey of novel devices in data-driven storytelling notes a lack of applications showcasing data-driven storytelling in AR, despite the potential of physical props to enhance these experi- ences [24]. Using the multimodal input and output of AR displays, designers can craft data-driven stories that allow the audience to become immersed in the story. In the same way that visualizations embedded on a webpage supplement a journalist’s narrative, we con- sider how situated visualization can supplement an AR presentation. Our work investigates AR as a medium for telling a data-driven sci- entiﬁc story contextualized in physical space on physical equipment. 2.3 Immersive Visualization Use of immersive AR for visualization provides several beneﬁts over traditional display media."

(RG4) Favor adoption over features: As a ﬁnal, broad require- ment that encompasses the previous RG requirements, we prioritize any decision that would lead to more feasible integration even if it comes at the expense of interesting features. Integration of an AR display into tours is already a fairly signiﬁcant technological intervention, so any design decision should avoid increasing friction to adoption. 4H YDROGEN AR S YSTEM In this section, we describe the design and implementation of Hydro- genAR, a data-driven presentation tool that provides key information about hydrogen fueling to tour groups. The system delivers an inter- active tour using slides, situated labels and visualizations at points of interest and an interactive simulation of a ﬁll-up through the Magic Leap One. HydrogenAR also provides supervisory control to the tour administer using the Magic Leap One remote."
A252,HydrogenAR: Interactive Data-Driven Presentation of Dispenser Reliability,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Our design process also allows us to consider implications of our design and user feedback for future iterations of HydrogenAR and AR data-driven storytelling in general. 6.1 Implications for AR Data-Driven Storytelling The problems that the Hydrogen Fuel team had with giving tours and presentations aligned well with the beneﬁts of using AR. Thought they had data from simulated hydrogen ﬁlls, those simulations were run in non-descript boxes outside, making it difﬁcult for visitors to conceptually map those simulations to a real dispenser. On the other hand, the team had a real dispenser set up inside where many tour groups walk by, but the lack of any interactive components, data, or narrative that would give the equipment context, making it seem sterile and inaccessible to passers-by. This combination of a wealth of data with a lack of context provided an ideal opportunity for AR data-driven storytelling. Future AR data-driven storytelling applications should focus on bridging gaps between important data and physical context, delivering it in novel, engaging ways, such that it does not get lost in traditional decontextualized media. Application designers need to consider the user experiences both for the end-user and for the tour administer driving the experience. 709 Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The followingdifferences were found: South Korean television networks ( KBS,SBS,MBC ,and JTBC ) highlight social issues, politics, and lifestyle; while American television networks ( ABC, CBS,NBC,CNN ) cover the economy, social issues, and politics. Both television networks rely on government sources and seldom provide raw data. The South Korean networks use a static graph and an infographic most frequently, while the US networks favor anumber pull quote and a static graphic."

Researchers and journalists deﬁne the practice of producing data news as data journalism and emphasize that news media are able to reveal the truth by analyzingdata not available to citizens using software (Bradshaw, 2010; Parasie and Dagiral,2012). Data journalism comprises data-driven practices combined with two distinctareas: computer science and journalism (Lim, 2015). Data journalism deserves interest from the scholarly community as well as news businesses for two reasons. First, journalists face an information environment featuring volume and wideavailability of data, and journalists need to examine the nature of data insteadof gatekeepers at the traditional news media (Bradshaw, 2015)."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"Television networks recognize the values of data journalism andproduce diverse content assisted by specialized departments and staﬀ members.Data news might be seen as an ideal form of television news, as the latter hashigh visual appeal. Researchers have previously taken up case studies of info-graphic applicability (Choi, 2015; Kim, 2014), newspapers’ production of datanews (Daniel and Flew, 2010; Karlsen and Stavelin, 2014; Royal, 2010), andthe status of data journalism (Anderson, 2013; Cohen et al., 2011; Lim, 2015; Shin, 2014). However, theoretical research on how data journalism practices are represented in television news is limited, because few have analyzed the characteristics and newsforms of data news content of television networks across diﬀerent countries. In thepresent study, South Korean and US television networks were chosen for investi-gation for four reasons. First, South Korean television networks have garneredmuch interest from the public and the academic by systematically analyzing andvisualizing the spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) since its outbreak in May 2015. KBS and SBS, two Korean networks, have created a data journalism team and led these data journalism practices by regularly produ-cing data news content. Second, this study was based on South Korea, whichpromotes an open data policy and an analytical approach toward data forpublic services as well as education. Third, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and manyUS local aﬃliated networks actively produce data news contents known as info-graphics, which oﬀer many interesting examples with similarities to and diﬀerenceswith South Korean television networks. Fourth, Korean broadcasting journalists have visited US networks to learn their data journalism practices (Korea Broadcasting Journalist Association, 2014). A comparison of data journalism practices of the two countries’ networks can reveal interesting theoretical and practical insights. This study compared one yearof data news content from major television networks in South Korea and the US,2 the International Communication Gazette 0(0) which shows the advantages of cross-country analysis and the depth of data col- lected. The most similar systems design model assumes that countries share bothsimilar as well as dissimilar traits and analyzes how variables of interest varyaccording to these diﬀerences (Przeworski and Teune, 1970). Researchers havealso applied this model to an analysis of German and US online journalists’ char-acteristics (Quandt et al., 2006). Researchers view the utility of data journalism from technological perspectives such as big data and visual software."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"The secondobjective is to ﬁnd news forms embedded in data news content. The categorizationof news forms could contribute to the better theorizing of data journalism andreﬁning the concept of data news in television content. The third objective is tosuggest a direction of data journalism for television news by providing the best and worst data news content. The concept of data journalism and its characteristics The term ‘data journalism’ emerged in 2006 as scholars began thinking of journal- ism as programming, focusing on data as the essence of news making (Gynnild,2014). Researchers refer to data journalism in various ways—as ‘data-driven jour-nalism,’ ‘computational journalism,’ ‘journalism as programming,’ ‘programming as journalism,’ ‘open-source movement,’ and ‘news applications’ (Cohen et al., 2011; Gynnild, 2014). These terms testify to the fact that data journalism is diﬀer-ent from traditional journalism but that it follows existing news-making routines.The function of providing the public with important issues is signiﬁcant, althoughdata journalism takes data as its starting point."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data-driven news,"The typical indicators for the popularity ofdata journalism include international award events for data-driven news projectsand journalists’ participation in training camps for data analysis. Data journalismawards by the Global Editors Network have attracted major news media, includingthe Guardian ,BBC,The New York Times ,The Wall Street Journal ,The Washington Post,Financial Times ,ProPublica ,Zeit Online , and The Economist . News organi- zations and interested groups from 39 countries also participated in the awards since 2012; 76.8% of these organizations were newspapers, television networks, and other news organizations (Kim and Lim, 2016). News organizations and journalists show considerable interest in data journal- ism practices."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"Some data journalists form Facebook groups and promote their data news and share their knowledge withother journalists (Appelgren, 2016). In addition to increasing interest in data journalism, these practices have the advantage of improving the current status of journalism, which has suﬀered frompoor credibility by inducing participation from users. By utilizing analytic softwareand technologies, data journalism practices help users understand current issues. Because data journalism is based on crowd-sourcing and an open-source environ- ment, users can experience news from their perspectives (Hamilton and Turner,2009)."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"Data news content constituted only 6–22% of the stories in 15 British news- papers, including the Guardian ,Daily Mail , and The Independent (Knight, 2015). The most frequent data journalistic elements in the newspapers included an info-graphic, a static map, a chart, and a number pullout, while the least frequentelements included an interactive map, a list, a data description, a table, and atimeline. The content relied on institutional sources. Further, journalists are notinterested in providing users with raw data and prefer to use a graphic, a table, or asearch function as supporting materials for a story (Karlsen and Stavelin, 2014).The data news content of the Chicago Tribune from 2002 to 2009 featured an in- depth interview, a chart, a table, and a map (Parasie and Dagiral, 2012). The data journalism practices are likely to be reﬂected in speciﬁc news forms. News forms and data news News forms are not the results of technology, but products of political culture andreﬂect power relations between journalists, politicians, and the public (Barnhurst,2012). News forms are a useful concept for understanding news texts. For instance, an analysis of television news reveals three news forms: narrative, visualization, and talk (Corner, 1995). The narrative of television news creates a meaningful andimportant story, while visualization helps viewers understand news coveragevisually."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"Similar news forms can be present in the data news content of television net- works. Television news represents issues symbolically through visualization insteadof direct description (Corner, 1995). This trait can relate to the implications ofvisual elements of data news content. Visual elements include a dynamic map, agraph/a chart, an infographic, a list, a number pullout, a static map, a table, and a timeline (Knight, 2015). These elements allow users to experience the relevance and immediacy of issues. When this study reviewed previous data journalism researchin terms of these news forms, data news content was found to be based on ‘inter-pretation,’ ‘visualization,’ ‘complexity,’ and ‘participation.’ Data journalist elements such as maps or other visuals contain these news forms and have a certain complex and visual appeal. For instance, an interactive map andan infographic have a high level of interpretative complexity and visual appeal(Knight, 2015). This interactivity contributes to increased visits to news homepages and revenue generation. The Texas Tribune generates thousands of dollars in rev- enue by linking the state employees’ salary database to external surveys (Batsell,2015)."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"Given this consideration, the present study comparesdata news content in the South Korean and US television networks and identiﬁesthe patterns of data journalistic elements and news forms. Previous researchdivided data journalistic elements into an infographic, a static map, a chart, anumber pull quote, a list, a table, and a timeline (Knight, 2015). Given thereview of previous data journalism research, this study asks the following research question: RQ1: How are such data journalistic elements as infographics, maps, or tables presented in the news content of major South Korean and US televisionnetworks?6 the International Communication Gazette 0(0) Speciﬁc forms embedded in data news content could imply the nature and direction of the production of this content. Accordingly, this study asks the second researchquestion : RQ2: What types of news forms are embedded in the data news content of major South Korean and US television networks? Method Unit of analysis and data collection South Korean and US national television networks and cable networks were the focus of analysis. Following previous research (Knight, 2015), this study deﬁneddata news as content that contains such elements as a table, a static or dynamic graphic, or a chart, either supporting or independent of a news text. Dynamic content provides numbers, short descriptions, or other relevant informationwhen users place a cursor on their corresponding elements. Table 1 shows a speciﬁc location for data collection. For the South Korean networks, three national networks ( KBS,SBS, and MBC ) and a cable network (JTBC ) were chosen."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"KBS operates its specialized department, called the ‘Dataroom,’ and its website provides relevant data news content. SBS published a series entitled ‘Data news,’ but the network website did not allow access to content containing this term. This study collected the content by searching key- words ‘SBS News’ and ‘Data news’ on Google. This study evaluated whether thecontent clearly belonged to SBS by examining stories headlined ‘Date news’ as wellas bylines. This procedure captured more data news stories of SBS than those ofany other networks. MBC provided news content under the sections named ‘15 seconds,’ ‘MBVideo,’ and ‘MBCard,’ where this study collected data news. Table 1.

The examined US television networks included ABC ,CBS,NBC , and CNN . CNN was chosen because it was a popular news channel."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"Data news content from these three channels was also collected. Local and regional televisionstations aﬃliated with the national networks and CNN also produced data news content, which was collected. For instance, WHTM-TV is located at Harrisbug, PA and has a partnership with ABC ;NBC 10 is a local station in Philadelphia aﬃliated with NBC . However, data news content from wire services was excluded. Unlike their South Korean counterparts, the US television networks did not label their content as ‘data news.’ This study searched stories by entering the following terms into network websites: ‘data visualization,’ ‘visualization,’ ‘inter- active,’ ‘infographic,’ ‘interactive infographics,’ ‘mapping,’ ‘tables and data,’‘charts and data,’ ‘data infographics,’ ‘data analysis,’ ‘data mapping,’ ‘data clean-ing,’ and ‘visualization and interactive.’ Visual contents of these stories cannot be presented in this study as copyright regulations do not allow reproduction without permission.

The one-year period may be consid-ered relatively short, but given that data journalism has been established in televi-sion newsrooms, the period should be suﬃcient to identify relevant data newscontent for analysis. Procedure of data analysis Basic variables This study focused on news topics, data journalistic elements, complexity and visual appeal of the elements, and data sources based on previous data journalismresearch (Knight, 2015). News topics were divided into leisure/entertainment, life- style, international issues, social issues, science/environment, health/welfare, poli- tics, economy, education, and sports. Data journalistic elements included 18 categories in a sequential order: a static table, a dynamic table, a static graphic, a static infographic, a dynamic graphic,8 the International Communication Gazette 0(0) a dynamic infographic, a static graph, a dynamic graph, a static chart, a dynamic chart, a static map, a dynamic map, a data video clips, a timeline, a list, a numberpull quote, raw data, and a news application."

The focus was on writing theoretical observations byconsidering the nature of data journalistic elements instead of the speciﬁc contentthemes. This approach was an active analysis involving identifying the meaning ofthe elements. A short summary of thoughts and opinions through this procedure isa code (Charmaz, 2012)—which is a meaning that is revealed clearly from the data—and the concept resulting from the relationship between codes is a category (Rennie, 2006)."

Government sources are most preferred by traditional television net-works, and this is consistent with perspectives of an elite model or an indexinghypothesis (Althaus et al., 1996; Reese et al., 1994). The elite model assumes thatpower elites are interconnected within and across television networks."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"For instance, the data newscontent of the Chicago Tribune from 2002 to 2009 used the Illinois state govern- ment and federal government as sources (Parasie and Dagiral, 2012). In the presentstudy, the Korean networks were found to follow the journalistic rule of givingmore weight to oﬃcial sources, even for the production of data news. In contrast,US counterparts relied on quantiﬁed sources that could ﬁt the focus of data jour-nalism on the data itself. Less provision of raw data: Low level of transparency Data journalism demands our attention because it allows users to analyze data andcompare their own results against reporters’ analysis (Daniel and Flew, 2010; Grayet al., 2012). In the present study, the South Korean television networks did notmake data available to users at all and the US networks did not provide the data in98.8% of the data news content. ABC linked three data news items to PDF ﬁles containing detailed analytic results. These ﬁndings were consistent with previous research (Lim, 2016) in which cases of reporters providing raw data for newscontent constituted only 7.1% of the total. The degree of data opening is linked to the issue of transparency of news-making processes. The level of transparency of data news content for both countries’ net-works was surprisingly low, given that data journalism values user participation,feedback, and sharing data analysis with users. Findings of research questions Diﬀerent types of data journalistic elements and news forms were present in thesame content. The South Korean and US television content contained multipledata journalistic elements and news forms. For instance, one item consisted of atext, a news application, a static graphic, and a static table."

The South Korean networks focus onsocial issues, politics, and lifestyle, while the US networks cover the economy,social issues, and politics. Government sources are the most frequent sourcesused by television networks in both countries. Next, the South Korean networks rely on polls/news media data, while their US counterparts do not provide sources or use companies as sources."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"Certain types of news forms regulate the production of data news content in both countries’ television networks in similar and diﬀerent ways. News forms reﬂect political culture and reveal power relations between journalists, politicians, and citizens (Barnhurst,2012). From the perspective of power relations, the ﬁnding that the news formof participation is rare in both countries’ data news content implies that the net-works try to control the process of producing content, and considering the audi-ence as passive. Because the television networks are responsible for producing datanews content, the representation of the content focuses on its delivery to audiences.Consequently, visualization, condensity, and typiﬁcation are the most dominant news forms. Without the active participation of users, the data news content of the two countries’ networks serve as functional items aided by visuals and numericinformation. The theoretical advantage of news forms includes the fact that it helps us to deﬁne what data journalism is. That is, data journalism is a process through which20 the International Communication Gazette 0(0) news media represent public issues with visuals and categories, condense informa- tion, include suﬃcient information, and provide context. Furthermore, data jour-nalism practices induce user participation and produce easy-to-understand newscontent independent of a story."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"The irony is that the presence of contexuality in data news content for the two countries’ networks is low, despite the fact that data serves as a basis for further reasoning and accountsfor empirical evidence (Kitchin, 2014). A context, a background, or a historyshould be emphasized in data news content. In this sense, the present study deﬁnesdata news content as public news about current issues visualized and contextua-lized on the basis of data analysis. The other theoretical implication comes from intriguing results aided through comparing the data news content of South Korean and US television networks on the basis of the most similar systems design model. This model of cross-country analyses should be performed extensively in data journalism research. The cross-country analysis in this study shows that the television networks in both countriesreveal similarities and diﬀerences regarding the production of data news. The USnetworks take a more quantitative approach than their South Korean counter-parts, but both networks seldom provide raw data to users. Follow-up studiesare required to examine the causes of these similarities and diﬀerences by consider-ing journalistic culture and news-gathering routines. Some noteworthy diﬀerences in data news content between South Korean and US television networks indicate that diﬀerent journalistic rules regulate theproduction of content. For instance, the Korean networks apply the traditionaljournalistic rule of relying on oﬃcial sources to the production of data news.In contrast, the US networks use quantiﬁed sources, which reﬂect the focus ofdata journalism on data. The South Korean networks prefer more complex,more visually appealing, and less interactive elements. Though it may seem contra-dictory, the rule of controlling the production of data news by limiting user parti- cipation explains this tendency. The South Korean networks are likely to consider data journalism as a channel for attracting more visitors to consume their content.The US networks use simple elements that are not visually appealing, but are moreinteractive. Thus, the South Korean networks consider more visual aspects of datanews content, while the US networks value data-oriented interactive aspects ofcontent. This study suggests three possible guidelines with regard to the production of data news for television networks. First, television networks need to incorporate the participation of users into news-making processes because they are essential for the success of data journalism. Reporters view guaranteeing users’ access to infor-mation as a major advantage of data journalism, as compared with traditionaljournalism (Lim, 2016). The two countries’ networks did not develop a procedurethrough which users can actively participate in the production of data newsLim 21 content. One solution for facilitating participation might be to produce such inter- active content as news applications that allow users to search and identify whatthey need. In addition, CEOs of television networks need to hire programmers anddesigners for news applications and provide reporters with training programs.The cooperation of reporters with computer experts and graphic designers,as well as training in computing, is essential to the success of data journalism(Flew et al., 2012). Second, television networks need to provide visual, multi-dimensional informa- tion independently of news text."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"This is important because too much information negatively aﬀectsusers’ understanding of data news content. Third, television networks could enhance the transparency of news-making pro- cesses by introducing data journalism practices. The two countries’ networksseldom provide raw data to users, making it diﬃcult for them to overcome thetendency to control the whole process of news making. The value of data journal-ism lies in the possibility that it can overcome the less transparent practices of theexisting news-making processes."
A254,Representation of data journalism practices in the South Korean and US television news,1,1,data news,"However, in this study, no data news content from South Korean television networks provided raw data tothe public, and only 1.2% of US data news content provided raw data. Newsorganizations need to link data journalistic elements to news texts, and providedata and detailed materials to users for further feedback. In summary, the practices of data journalism are established in television net- works in diﬀerent countries (e.g., South Korea and US) in similar and diﬀerentways. The practices raise several further research questions, such as how data journalism coexists with traditional journalism focusing on objectivity and inverted-pyramid writing and the extent to which user participation may be securedin the production of data news. The content of the two countries’ networkssimultaneously reveals similarities and diﬀerences, indicating the need for morecross-country analyses. Future researchers need to conduct a wide comparison of22 the International Communication Gazette 0(0) data news practices across multiple diﬀerent countries such as Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Africa. The potential of data journalism to changethe fundamentals of current news-making industries are likely to depend on thor-ough theoretical analysis and explanation of current trends in data journalism. Thepresent study’s ﬁndings could serve as a baseline for such endeavors.

INTRODUCTION   Since the increase and rise of data journalism, it has sparked  interest among researchers and designers in narrative  visualization to better support public health practice [1]. By  combining the p resentation form of visualization and narrative  mechanism, narrative visualization leverages the ability to  describe stories as exciting and memorable data health news,  enabling information to be communicated more effectively to  the public through storytel ling and advocating the use of  storytelling techniques in information visualization. Existing health behavior interventions have been communicated to the  public through narrative visualization methods of  communication. Prior research has shown that narrati ve intervention  messages may be effective in promoting and eliciting positive  behavior change on a variety of health topics, as they can elicit  individual attitudes consistent with the story and increase  behavioral intentions, including promoting physical activity [2],  breast cancer detection [3], healthy eating [4], and sexual health  [5]. Sleep is important for the promotion of physical and mental  health. Sleep disorders may greatly threaten people’s  cognitive  ability, mood, immunity, quality of life, wel l-being, learning,  socialization, and psychological, physical, and social functioning [6 , 7]."

To this end, we need to understand  better the factors driving the expected public sleep behavior change and how to understand better the impact of narrative  visualization on the intention to change the behavior of engaging in sleep health promotion.

A258,A study of the impacts of message framing and narrative visualization on sleep behavior intervention,1,1,narrative visualization,"The current study was designed with two dimensions:  narrative visualization and message framing. As a novel  method of data representation, the impact of narrative  visualizations on sleep health behavioral intervention is  unknown. To increase the understanding of sleep health  messages, we use narrative visualization to present the  information [1 9]. It has been shown that the format of narrative  information can affect comprehens ion and memorability  because the process of decision -making tends to be more  empirical and emotional than rational [ 20, 2 1]. Few studies  about health behavior intervention based on narrative  visualization that has been conducted, but it remains  challenging  to determine if narrative visualization has an  impact on and how it relates to behavioral intentions. By measuring the impact of ""narrative visualization"" and  ""message framing"" on people's intended engagement, this paper  aims to examine how to provide mor e effective forms of sleep  health messaging that allow the public to understand and  change their health behaviors. In summary, our study considered these two questions:  (1) What factors strongly correlated with the intention of  participation in sleep health behavior? The factors studied here were combined from the TPB and PMT.   (2) Does the message form and framing affect the factors  of the intention related to sleep  health behavior change? We  expect that receiving positive information framing will at least   increase sensitivity to perceived threats compared to negative  information framing."

A258,A study of the impacts of message framing and narrative visualization on sleep behavior intervention,1,1,narrative visualization,"From the above results, it can be seen that the two  hypotheses proposed were verified, that is, narrative visualization and message framing have significant effects on  people’s behavioral intention in the process of behavior change. As shown by the above results negative framing  information enhances the perception of response resistance  better than positive framing information. On the other hand,  positive framing information can enhance the perception of  behavioral attitude better than negative framing information. Moreover, the form of narrative visualization had a more  significant effect on the per ceived threat. In the e -health  communication public program, adding narrative visualization  information, such as the consequences of unhealthy sleep  behaviors, could possibly increase awareness of the  consequences of sleep deprivation. Most importantly, t he form  of narrative visualization for health behavior change has great potential to become a more acceptable form of intervention for the public to adopt and make changes. There is a limitation of this study. The selected population  in this paper is homog eneous, as respondents were recruited  through an existing group in sampling.

Crucially, Segel and Heer noted a tension in narrative visualization forms between author-driven explanationandreader-drivenexploration(or,asmightapplytoradio,listener-drivenexploration). Thisraisesquestionsaboutwhois,andwho shouldbe,in chargeof findinginsightin data[ 64]. Radio presents unique challenges and opportunities for conveying the experience of finding insight in data: As a linear medium that progresses in one direction (forward), radio might be best suited for author-driven explanation, as is video [ 75].

In contrast with breaking news, which favours “speed over nuance” [ 45], the goal of explanatory journalism is “civic clar- ity”[21].Explanatoryreportingplaysacriticalroleinafunctioningdemocracybycontributingto aninformed,engagedpublic[ 32,45].JournalistandwritingcoachClarkencouragespractitioners to “slow down the pace of information,” “introduce new characters or difficult concepts one at a time,”“recognizethevalueofrepetition,”“use[apt]analogies,”“developachronology,”“rewardthe reader,”and“announcedifficultconcepts”[ 21].In ourwork,we employ many of theseprinciples. Historian Kathy Forde argues that the qualities people seek in news reporting reflect broader epistemological values: Whereas the “inverted pyramid” style of conventional news reports “re- flectedsociety’swidespreadfaithinrealismandtheauthorityoffacts,”explanatoryreportsreflect adesirefor“interpretationofcomplexeventsandphenomenaplacedinsocial,political,orcultural context” [ 32]. A renewed hunger for explanatory journalism has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic: Clark claimed we are in a “potential golden age of explanatory journalism” as experts in health,science,andbusinesscontributeexplanatoryreportsaboutthecurrentcrisis[ 21]."

The full table we produced through Section 4.4is included in our supplementary materials. In this section, we highlight select design principles from each domain, examine how these principles were present or absent in the radio pieces, and discuss how we might reapply them to an interactive narra- tive sonification using voice user interfaces like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google Home, and Microsoft’sCortana. 6.1 Guidance Design: Building an EvolvingModelof Listener Needs Guidance design, used in visual analytics, is “a computer-assisted process that aims to actively resolveaknowledgegapencounteredbyusersduringaninteractive...session”[ 18].Ithasitsroots in mixed-initiative systems, where sometimes humans drive the action and sometimes machines do.Eventhoughradioisnotamixed-initativesystem,wenotethatmixedinitiativeswerepresent in our radio pieces: Sometimes Ryssdal teed up a sonification and other times Wirfs-Brock did, thus the radio pieces are both novice- and expert-driven. Success in guidance design depends on being able to correctly identify and then address users’ knowledge gaps [18]."

Data-driven storytelling can be simultaneously explanatory andex- ploratory by balancing interpretation that prescribes how the viewer should understand the data with flexible, open-ended opportunities for the viewer to analyze the data on their own [ 82]. Our radio pieces were mostly explanatory, as demonstrated by how we provided context and inter- pretations of the data. Voice user interfaces could, in addition to explaining, also nudge listeners towards exploration by asking if they would like to hear the same data, but with a different sonic representation;ortohearthesamesonicrepresentation,butforadifferenttimeperiod.Listeners might alsobe abletozoom into examine a particularday orweekin more detail.

Foucault (1985: 28) describes the very deliberate, practical work ofethical subject formation as this process: The individual delimits that part of himself that will form the object of his moral practice, define his position relative to the precept he will follow, and decides on acertain mode of being that will serve as his moral goal. And this requires him toact on himself, to monitor, test, improve, and transform himself. Such delimiting, positioning, and transforming myself in relation to others was to make myself active, rather than passive, in moderating my pleasures –or keeping them in their proper place."

This article is an open access publication Abstract Purpose Freight vehicle parking facilities at large urban freight traffic generators, such as urban retail malls, are often characterized by a high volume of vehicle arrivals and a poor parking supply infrastructure. Recurrent congestion of freight parking facilities generates environmental (e.g. pollution), economic (e.g. delays in deliveries) and social (e.g. traffic) negative externalities. Solutions aimed at either improving or better managing the existing parking infrastructure rely heavi- ly on data and data-driven models to predict their impact and guide their implementation."
A273,Data stories from urban loading bays,1,1,data stories,"Insights from this data collection effort are relayed as data stories. We first describe the parking facility at a mall as a queueing sys- tem, where freight vehicles are the agents and their decisions are the parking location choice and the parking duration. Results Using the data collected, we analyse (i) the arrival rates of vehicles at the observed malls, (ii) the empirical distribution of parking durations at the loading bays, (iii) the factors that influence the parking duration, (iv) the empirical distribution ofwaiting times spent by freight vehicle queueing to access the loading bay, and (v) the driver parking location choices and how this choice is influenced by system congestion. Conclusions This characterisation of freight driver behaviour and parking facility system performance enables one to un- derstand current challenges, and begin to explore the feasibil- ity of freight parking and loading bay management solutions."

The interventions are meant to dynamically highlight in the visualization the datapoints that are described in the textual sentence currently being read by the user, as captured by eye-tracking. These in- terventions were previously evaluated in two user studies that involved 98 participants reading excerpts of real-world MSNVs during a 1-hour session.

Narrative visualization (NV) is a technique that uses drawings, photographs, and text to contextualize data, which may increase integrated regulation, or motivation for PA by relating it to personal values and identity. The purpose of this study was to determine the acceptability of a NV intervention for older breast cancer survivors. Methods: Participants completed an NV workbook for 7 days using the provided instant camera, art supplies including a variety of stickers, and a wearable electronic activity monitor. The workbook pages prompted participants to re-draw their daily activity graphs from the monitor’s mobile app, then annotate them with text, photographs, stickers, etc. to re ect what the data meant to them."
A277,ACCEPTABILITY OF NARRATIVE VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES WITH MONITORING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DATA AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS,1,1,narrative visualization,"A novel way to target this form of motivation is narrative visualization (NV), a process of using annotation to help tell a story related to data presentation [26, 27]. NV uses drawings, photographs, and annotation to contextualize data. For example, one study used a scrapbook that included photographs and text annotating each photo and found that this process helped individuals  nd patterns in their daily arousal and relaxation [28]. Other investigators used an app that prompted users to regularly look at old photographs and add new annotations."

Often these professionals are relied upon for speciﬁc functions, for example, writing interfaces to extract data for analysis. Sometimes it is as simple as that, extract the data and let an analyst analyze it and present it. However, too many times this data can be complicated, espe- cially in the world of big data."
A278,A Case for Introducing Visual Data Storytelling in CS/CIS Curriculums,1,1,data storytelling,"Thus, we make our case for introducing visual data storytelling in CS and CIS curriculums. 1 Introduction The third industrial revolution began in the late 1900’s with the advent of ARPANET in 1969, and the development of Ethernet in 1973, contributing ∗Copyright ©2022 by the Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges.

This era experienced a rise in electronics not previously seen, from computers to new technologies of automation, advancement in telecommuni- cations and widespread globalization."
A278,A Case for Introducing Visual Data Storytelling in CS/CIS Curriculums,1,1,data storytelling,"Because of this, Ahmed stated the need for Visual Data Storytelling skills calling this “a skill set handcrafted for the era of big data.” We can hypothesize that today’s students enrolled in computer programming or computer information systems curriculum need to be introduced to Visual Data Storytelling. 3 Visual Data Storytelling Most experts agree that data storytelling is the ability to convey data not just numbers as or charts, but as a narrative that recipients can understand. Ahmed and Pathan [1] explained that a good story needs to be presented without bias, and needs to have a beginning, a middle and end. In this way, business users can absorb and leverage the insights for better decision-making. Programmers or data scientists do not often make decisions, but they need to ensure that they get the right data in the right format to those who do."
A278,A Case for Introducing Visual Data Storytelling in CS/CIS Curriculums,1,1,data stories,"As a result, students not only show- case their learning but also improve technical skills and improve their research and writing skills.45 Humphrey [9] elaborated, stating, “Visual data stories have been shown to signiﬁcantly aid the comprehension and short-term memorability of statistical facts and value messages.” As a result, Humphrey believes that these visual data stories are great for communicating complex information to target audi- ences. Creating these stories often requires a number of tools to execute the story creation process. Humphrey found that current information visualization tools either focus on exploration or lack sequencing models for visualization pre- sentation. Probably the most important piece of comprehensible visual data stores is the sequencing of visualization pieces which make up the visual data story."
A278,A Case for Introducing Visual Data Storytelling in CS/CIS Curriculums,1,1,data storytelling,"The skill of data storytelling is in removing the noise from the presentation and focusing people’s attention on key insights. Being literate with data and able to explain it though stories is now consid- ered a core skill which cuts across all divisions and roles within most companies. Much like communications, some roles will require a better understanding than others, but everyone who’s job it is to inform via data will not escape the need to understand and explain that data to others. In fact, as reported by Stack- pole [13] Althea Davis, enterprise data governance manager at Etihad Aviation Group, said that data storytelling is a much-needed enterprise skill. This state- ment is backed up by a quick search on Indeed.com (5/20/22) searching for46 “data storytelling” which came up with 15,152 jobs across the United States. Even just looking for programmers with analytic skills on Indeed revealed over 11,000 job openings in May 2022. 5 Tools There are many tools available for visual data storytelling, starting with prob- ably the most basic visualization tool, Microsoft Excel. This is ﬁne for simple graphs and charts but it is not very powerful as compared to tools such as Mi- crosoft Power BI, SAP Analytics Cloud, or Tableau analytics. In our university program we have used all of these but have settled in on using Tableau, which has free student licenses that are good for one year. Tableau supports the task of producing visualizations from raw data, either as a part of the exploration process or the ﬁrst phase of the visual data story creation process. This is of- ten done by simply connecting Tableau to an Excel sheet loaded with data or connecting to an SQL database. The visualizations can then be recorded (i.e., exported or saved) for presentation purposes outside the system. Obviously, there are plenty of tools, but more importantly is how these tools are used."
A278,A Case for Introducing Visual Data Storytelling in CS/CIS Curriculums,1,1,data storytelling,"Because data storytelling is goal oriented, the visualization needs to be aligned with a purpose or intention. In doing this, it provides designers and researchers with clearer boundaries about what needs to be communicated and what does not. 2. Visual and narrative elements should be used to drive the audience’s focus of attention and create meaning in the visualization. This can be accomplished by using speciﬁc elements such as lines, weight, shapes, size, colors, and contrast to emphasize key aspects of the visualization. 3."
A278,A Case for Introducing Visual Data Storytelling in CS/CIS Curriculums,1,1,data storytelling,"Data storytelling relies on using an appropriate visual and various techniques for certain purposes. As an example, line charts can eﬀectively show changes over time [12]. By contrast, Knaﬂic [8] dedicates an entire chapter to justifying why pie charts should not be used. 4. One must realize that clutter in data visualizations adds complexity to the graph and makes it harder to understand [8, 12]."

One of students49 who works for a Fortune 500 company as a programmer/analyst, had an enor- mous amount of data that tracked various errors from their systems around the world. The data was overwhelming, but he tried to put graphs and charts together to show upper management using MS-Excel. Unfortunately, with all his eﬀorts, management did not seem to get the big picture."
A278,A Case for Introducing Visual Data Storytelling in CS/CIS Curriculums,1,1,data storytelling,"As a result of this exercise, the company purchased Tableau for all their data analysts and provided them with the Visual Data Storytelling books we use in our course. 7 Conclusion As demonstrated, we can no longer expect programmers to simply be pro- grammers. Today they are often asked to extract huge amounts of data that then need to be analyzed and presented to management. Sometimes these pro- grammers will work with an analyst who has a lot of training in storytelling, but often they will ﬁnd themselves in the position of having to tell the story themselves. We also found via Indeed, a huge need for data scientists, data storytellers and programmers with analytical skills, and that this demand will only continue to grow."
A278,A Case for Introducing Visual Data Storytelling in CS/CIS Curriculums,1,1,data storytelling,"Therefore, we make the case that CS and CIS students should be introduced to visual data storytelling. It should be done throughout the program/curriculum using tools as Tableau, with a ﬁnal, formal course in Visual Data Storytelling. This ﬁnal course teaches the students how to present to management in a logical, easy to understand way.51 References [1] Mohiuddin Ahmed and Al-Sakib Khan Pathan.

For scholars considering investigation  strategies and networking theories, Lombardi’s work has, over the last couple of  decades, become a topic of formal fascination,44 and in the discourses of literature, art  history, and philosophy emerging from a post-9/1 1 climate, his work is positioned as  paradigmatic of how art might engage with conspiracy and supranational paranoia.45 For  a contingency of arts writers, critics, economists, journalists, bloggers, and computer  scientists, Lombardi’s work has become something of an open invitation, resulting in  books, articles, and interactive websites mining the intersection of art and ﬁnance and  visualizing the sites of power operating in the background of the global economy.46 As opposed to Hadjithomas and Joreige’s galvanizing of affect, Lombardi tends  more toward a sensemaking strategy, ﬁnding drama in the data and the connections  therein. His work hijacks the infographic language of ﬁnance, all the while accruing  (cultural and capital) value by exposing ﬁnancial misdeeds. Loophole for All , 2013 On Friday, 15 February 2013, Wired.com  reported that artist Paolo Cirio, as part   of his new project, Loophole for All , had hacked government servers in the Cayman   Islands and had released a list of businesses anonymously incorporated in the   notorious tax haven.47 According to a statement shared by the artist, he had also   hijacked the corporate identities of more than 200,000 of these companies, replacing  their registered postal addresses with his own Cayman Islands-based mailbox."

Cirio’s Loophole for All  is a well-spun para-journalistic true crime tale, ﬁctional  in its telling and factual in its reporting. Cirio neither breached the servers of the  Cayman Islands General Registry, nor did he alter the mailing addresses of companies  registered in the tax haven; and the nondescript list of corporate identities he claimed  to have acquired by hacking the government database was, in fact, scraped from data  available for a nominal fee from the Cayman Islands Online Registry Information  Service (CORIS)."

Wilson Harvard University; University of Kentucky, USA Abstract In the context of the feverish pace in which the social sciences are grappling with the implications for a turn toward ‘big data’, I suggest a different starting point: that big data are not necessarily social science data. In this somewhat speculative provocation, I argue that we should lean more on the notion that social media are phenomena and less on the notion that social media are evidence of phenomena. In doing so, I sketch four areas of potential criticality for an emerging big data studies."
M1,Tapestry: A Different Kind of Conference on Storytelling with Data,1,1,storytelling with data,"12 March/April 2015  Published by the IEEE Computer Society 0272-1716/15/$31.00 © 2015 IEEE Graphically Speaking Editor: André Stork Tapestry: A Different Kind of Conference  on Storytelling with Data Robert Kosara Tableau Research Tapestry is an unusual conference, at least compared with academic gatherings. There  are no proceedings, and the presentations  are not chosen through peer review. What it is,  however, is a place to meet and exchange ideas for  people with a common interest. We started Tapestry to give people interested in  storytelling with data a place to discuss their work. This would not be limited to academics, quite the  opposite: the main people we had in mind were journalists as well as people working for nonpro/f_i  t  organizations, the government, and others. The  discussion started in spring 2012, when the topic was still obscure and there were hardly any  published papers on it yet. There are two types of talks at Tapestry: key- notes and short stories."
M1,Tapestry: A Different Kind of Conference on Storytelling with Data,1,1,storytelling with data,"While it  seems clear that adding a narrative can do that,  how to go about storytelling with data visualiza-tion is anything but obvious. Also, the importance  of focus, in particular when dealing with data that  has any complexity, cannot be overstated. Rounding out the day was Scott McCloud, author  of the book Understanding Comics  (William Morrow  Paperbacks, 1994). His talk was a combination of a tour through his book, bits of comic theory, and  many examples from comics illustrating his points."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data stories,"Given the practical power visu- alizations can have in communicating facts and opinions, the visualization research community has begun to pay more attention to the need and  use of visualization as a storytelling medium to  tell compelling data stories. In this article, we take a closer look at how the  visualization community has discussed visual sto-rytelling. We argue that so far the community has been using the term “storytelling” in a broad  way, without a clear consensus or discussion on  what a visual data story encompasses. Yet, despite  this wide view on what constitutes a data story,  visualization research on storytelling has mainly centered on how data visualization components contribute to communication. Instead, we argue  for /f_i  rst narrowing the scope of what visual data  stories encompass and then expanding our re-search focus to the whole process of transforming  data into visually shared stories, including forma- tive processes such as crafting narrative structures. Narrowing the scope of what is termed a data  story, for instance, by distinguishing between a  visual data story and a data visualization, helps us open the door for a more detailed examination, covering the aspects of the visual data storytell-ing process that have so far received less research  attention. We discuss the entire process of trans- forming data into visually shared stories, incorpo-rating steps involved in /f_i  nding insights (explore  data), turning these insights into a narrative  (make a story), and communicating this narrative to an audience (tell a story). We conclude with  research opportunities in visualization as a story- telling medium in the light of this broader process. Storytelling Scope The word “storytelling” has a long history during which it has been used in many ways in differ- ent domains."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data story,"Similarly, no single crisp de/f_i  nition of a “vi- sual data story” has emerged. We argue against using the broadest sense, which would consider  any shared visualization to be a data story, given  that visualization is by de/f_i  nition focused on mak-ing data visible—and thus on presenting data to a  viewer. A visualization can be thought of as hav- ing both design elements that form a story and  g5vis.indd   84 8/26/15   12:04 PM  IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications  85 presentation methods that have been used to tell  it.2 If we take this broadest view on visual data  stories, however, any images containing even sim - ple charts with little explanations or reading aids would be called visual data stories. To facilitate a more practical discussion on the structure of vi - sual data storytelling in the visualization commu - nity, we need to consider narrowing the scope of visual data stories. Several research papers have considered this  problem of defining what storytelling in the do - main of visualization encompasses. Edward Segel  and Jeffrey Heer introduced the term narrative vi - sualization , emphasizing visual stories that include  a narrative, or a series of causally related events. 3  They also showed that storytelling in the context of visualization cannot be separated from talk - ing about visual narratives, but it still needs to be  more concretely defined—in particular because the  differences and commonalities to traditional sto - rytelling mechanisms and strategies are not well  understood yet. They attempted to develop a bet - ter understanding of visual data stories by formu - lating the design space of narrative visualization. Jessica Hullman and Nicholas Diakopoulos began  with Segel and Heer’s term narrative visualization  and defined it as a genre that combines interac - tion techniques for exploratory control over in - sights gained and communicative, rhetorical, and persuasive techniques for conveying an intended “story.” 4 Similar to Segel and Heer, the authors  did not clearly define what constitutes a visual  data story but aim to better describe the visual - ization techniques involved in communicating an  intended message. Although these two approaches  are a great first step, as they are valuable for un - derstanding communication mechanisms for visu - alization in general, it is still unclear exactly what is or is not a visual data story. In discussing the process of transforming data  into visually shared stories, we propose that visual data stories can be thought of as follows:  ■A visual data story includes a set of story pieces— that is, specific facts backed up by data (such as  how energy consumption has changed over the  years).  ■Most of the story pieces are visualized to support one or more intended messages. The visualiza- tion includes annotations (labels, pointers, text,  and such) or narration to clearly highlight and emphasize this message and to avoid ambiguity  (especially for asynchronous storytelling).  ■Story pieces are presented in a meaningful order  or with a connection between them to support the author’s high-level communication goal, which can range from educating or entertaining  the viewers with illustration of facts to convinc - ing or persuading them with thought-provoking  opinions. Taking this narrower view of a visual data story,  we can exclude several types of stories not related  to visualization, allowing us to uncover research  opportunities relevant to the visualization com - munity. For example, typical stories told in books  and movies are not pertinent to our discussion un - less they are focused around data visualizations. In  addition, we exclude Web-based interactive visual - izations that support completely free exploration without any guidance. We also do not consider visual data stories to include, for example, charts  posted on the Web unless they are enriched with  written explanations or annotations that help the viewer capture the intended message. For example,  many visualizations that include only a title above  the chart usually leave the interpretation of the content entirely to the viewer. It is important to note that these last examples— simple charts created from data—can be turned into visual data stories according to our narrower scope  if the author added appropriate annotations for a  simple story or combined several to form a longer, more complex story. However, this process of turn - ing data into a visual story has so far received little attention. We argue that it is just as important to consider research on the process of creating a visual  data story as it is to understand which features best  communicate it. We describe such a possible pro - cess and open areas for research next. Figure 1. Example visual data story. A full Flash presentation, “Human  Development Trends, 2005,” is available at www.gapminder.org/downloads/human-development-trends-2005. g5vis.indd   85 8/26/15   12:04 PM 86 September/October 2015 Visualization ViewpointsVisual Data Storytelling Process In the past, few research papers have considered  a wider visual storytelling process. An exception  is the article by Robert Kosara and Jock Mackin - lay,5 which aimed to provide a high-level overview  of the state of storytelling research. They briefly mentioned a working model for how stories are  constructed based on how journalists work and ar - gued that visualization tools for analysis are rarely  usable for presentation purposes. Here, we contribute a much more detailed de - scription of the storytelling process in visualiza-tion with regard to activities, artifacts, and roles  involved to develop a more encompassing look at the visual storytelling process and to uncover open  areas for research."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data story,"Data  is the raw material that constitutes the source of the visual data story content. Pertinent data ex - cerpts are collected through exploratory analysis. These may be simple, such as recorded data facts or  steps from the analysis process. They may be more complex, such as derived data insights, interesting  sets or sequences within the data, and/or process  details and variations."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data story,"The result of data  exploration when making a visual data story is a collection of the chosen data excerpts. Making a Story To make a story, the data excerpts gathered in step one need to be assembled into a storyline that is  interesting, illuminating, and compelling. The se - quence plays a critical role in a story; the same  set of excerpts can have impact or can fall flat. A  significant part of making a story is the process  of constructing the storyline or plot."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"The visual data storytelling process involves transforming data into visually shared stories via three  main components (exploring data, making a story, and telling a story), although the progression need not be linear. g5vis.indd   86 8/26/15   12:04 PM  IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications  87Telling a Story Telling a story is the general process of material - izing the abstract plot and delivering the story. It  consists of the following activities: building a pre - sentation (creating story material with the chosen  medium), sharing the story using the story mate - rial, and finally receiving and handling the feed - back from the audience. In the building phase of telling a story, a plot  and story pieces are taken and turned into story material. Story material is the materialization of each piece of this abstract content through the  development of visual representations, interac - tions, animations, annotations, or narration."

To  increase the transparency and credibility of visual data stories throughout the visual data storytelling  process, we need to make it easier and more desir - able for authors to share underlying data and their  analysis process. Research Opportunities The storytelling process we have described here helps us identify and articulate several research opportu - nities. We first discuss missing efforts for the two  components of the visual data storytelling process— making a story and telling a story. We then reflect  on whether it is desirable to build an encompassing  tool that supports the entire visual data storytelling process. Finally, we underline the need to develop  novel methodologies to assess the quality of both  authoring and experiencing visual stories. Help People Make a Compelling Story While the visualization community has a pleth - ora of techniques supporting the exploration and  analysis of data, not much attention has been put  on helping a scripter make a story—that is, iden - tifying a sequence of compelling story pieces. In  practice, people often make a story (even if just  in their minds) while they are either exploring the data or building a presentation."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data story,"Yet, visualization  systems do not usually incorporate help for the  general making a story phase, and they particu - larly fall short in supporting people in the steps to  collect and organize excerpts from data explora- tion that are potentially interesting for the final visual data story. Furthermore, visualization sys - tems do not usually provide support for building a plot from such a collection. As a result, people have to keep track of a set of interesting visual - izations, often resorting to capturing them on an auxiliary storage such as creating a document with screen captures and notes. IBM’s i2 Analyst’s  Notebook is a rare exception in that it is aimed at  streamlining this process (see www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/analysts-notebook)."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data stories,"For example, as work  on Show Me 9 suggests an appropriate visualiza- tion for given data properties such as data type and dimension with other possibilities, a system  for story building can automatically suggest pos - sible data stories for given story properties (such  as story point, intended message, and goal). This  could benefit novices as well as people with ex - tensive training in communication (such as data  journalists) or with inherent storytelling skills  (the ability to create a compelling story). Make It Easier to Tell a Story Even authors inherently skilled at creating com - pelling story structures face the challenge of pro - ducing the story material. This step may prove extremely difficult and time consuming for people with low programming skills."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"It is important to derive study protocols, new methods, and analysis practices for  each phase of the visual data storytelling process  and attempt to evaluate the process as a whole. Because storytelling involves either people taking  on multiple roles (data analyst, scripter, editor, and presenter) or several people working together, the story creation and the delivery process can become  a collaborative activity. As such, a wealth of re - search opportunities open up. For example, collab - orative evaluation metrics could be applied or we could study communication successes and failures  between different people involved in the process."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,data storytelling,"Emerging Scenarios Our visual data storytelling process supports sev - eral scenarios involving storytelling with data by  taking different paths through the components  and different manifestations of each of the compo - nents. We envision that other storytelling opportu - nities exist that include visualization support, and it is interesting to consider whether our visual data storytelling process could be expanded, by adding  steps or activities, or modified to more clearly cap - ture emerging scenarios. For example, our story - telling process could support the audience actually taking on the role of data analyst, scripter, and/or  editor. Involving the audience in the story creation process by opening up the editing and scripting  roles is an exciting emerging scenario. For example,  Sprint’s Global Water Experiment (www.visualizing   .org/sprint/global-water-experiment), where the  audience could edit an initial visualization and  g5vis.indd   89 8/26/15   12:04 PM 90 September/October 2015Visualization Viewpoints data, illustrates the potential of collaborative story  creation."
M2,More Than Telling a Story: Transforming Data into Visually Shared Stories,1,1,storytelling with data,"We aim to facilitate better structured discus-sions around compelling techniques for  storytelling with data visualization by drawing a line between a visual data story and a general data visualization and narrowing the scope of what a  visual data story is. Considering the entire process  of transforming data into visually shared stories along with this more focused de/f_i  nition, we believe  it is possible to widen the scope of research around  visual data stories. By pursuing these new avenues of research in visual data storytelling process, vi- sualizations can enable more effective storytelling  with data. References  1. B.

From a purist point of view, this is not  a recommended practice in visualization. 1 Often,  adding embellishments is regarded as gratuitous  and super/f_l  uous because it may introduce errors in  the portrayal of information. In spite of this, Ellen Lupton provides a counterperspective: Tufte’s purist point of view is profound and compelling, but it may be overly restrictive."

They can be found on TV news, news application, and short video applications on mobile devices, and public spaces like large screens at libraries or museums. Typically, the general audience (an audience that does not have much background knowledge of the data presented in the video) watches these videos to learn some insights from the data. Thus, it is critical to communicate and inform them with facts, rather than display the time-series data linearly without any emphasis."
M4,Illustrating Changes in Time-Series Data With Data Video,1,1,data storytelling,"As one data storytelling practi- tioner mentioned,2“with numbers, it is good to explore them and turn them on their heads andtry them in different ways and see where the story is.” To our best knowledge, existing meth- ods either require much effort or are restricted by templates while highlighting these insights. To address these problems, we propose an approach which focuses on visually enhancing important changes in time-series data with data video. The approach assists data video creation by better support of data exploration, identiﬁca- tion for important timestamps, and providing ﬂexible operation with visual effects to highlight them in the video sequences. Authors can review and reﬁne the sequence."

M7,The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"FEATURE ARTICLE The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization Zhenpeng Zhao, Apple, Inc, Cupertino, CA, 95014-0642, USA Niklas Elmqvist ,University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 20742, USA The emerging practice of data-driven storytelling is framing data using familiar narrative mechanisms, such as slideshows, videos, and comics, to make even highly complex phenomena understandable. In this survey, we propose a taxonomy focused speci ﬁcally on media types for the purpose of widening the purview of data- driven storytelling by putting more tools into the hands of designers. The classi ﬁcation shows that current data-driven storytelling practice does not yet leverage the full repertoire of media that can be used for storytelling, such as the spoken word, e-learning, and video games. Using our taxonomy as a generative tool, we also explore three novel storytelling mechanisms, including for live streaming, gesture-driven oral presentations, and data-driven comics. From the hunter returning from his latest foray to tell tall tales of stalking his prey, to the sha- man spinning a yarn about the origins of the gods, the stars, and the moon, storytelling is one of the oldest forms of human communication, record keeping, and entertainment. Stories —sequences of events involving characters and places —are particu- larly well suited for this purpose because their chrono- logical structure enables recall, entices listeners, and facilitates understanding.1For this reason, narration and storytelling retain important roles even in today ’s society, where these properties are particularly impor- tant in helping people get to grips with an increasingly complex world."
M7,The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"This has recently given rise to data- driven storytelling2where narrative techniques are uti- lized for telling stories about data,3often using visual media.4 Examples of such data-driven storytelling abound (see Figure 1), and include data comics,5,6data videos,7 and data-driven slideshows.8The common denominator is that they are based on story arcs evolving over time to build an argument, explain a phenomenon, or report a ﬁnding. They diverge by the form of media , or channels of communication, they use: sequential art, animated graphics, presentation slides, handwriting, etc.However, while visual representations are particu- larly useful for storytelling, there are many additional types of media —digital and otherwise —that can be co-opted for telling stories about data. An existing framework proposed by Segel and Heer3outline seven genres of narrative visualization, but con ﬂates the storytelling mechanism with the media being used. Furthermore, Segel and Heer also note that their sample is limited (58 items) and does not cover the full scope of possible media that can be used for storytelling,3such as video games, infotainment, and other e-learning tools. Meanwhile, much research in data-driven storytelling has used these seven genres as a starting point, which suggests that the commu- nity may be limiting itself by needlessly adhering to a framework that was intended to be generative rather than prescriptive. What about using the spoken word for data-driven storytelling, i.e., supporting speakers talking to an audience? What about the written word (i.e., data- driven prose), such as for inclusion in a textual report? And what about other forms of human communica- tion, such as theatre, poetry, and even dance?"

M7,The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"We use the framework to postulate some potential future media types for data-driven storytelling. Finally, by generalizing across storytelling practice for different media, we derive design guidelines for data-driven sto- rytelling. We conclude this article with a summary and our plans for future work. DATA-DRIVEN STORYTELLING Storytelling is the conveyance of a sequence of events, often involving characters and places —sto- ries—using speech, sound, and visuals,1and has a his- tory spanning thousands of years. A visual narrative is a story told primarily using visual media, such as illus- trations, photographs, animations, video, and —now — visualization.4In particular, visualization has a speci ﬁc proclivity for communication by virtue of its graphical form, yielding the notion of communication-minded visualization10to support collaborative analysis.Combining the idea of communication-driven visuali- zation with storytelling yields the notion of data-driven storytelling: narrative techniques for telling stories about data.3 Narrative Visualization Segel and Heer3were the ﬁrst to propose the notion of narrative visualization , and used their initial survey to identify seven distinct story formats (see Figure 2)a s follows. ›Magazine style: A data-driven image integrated in a page of text, where the text refers to and explains the image. ›Annotated chart: Chart adorned with descriptive text and labels for the purpose of explaining its contents. ›Partitioned poster: A poster consisting of multi- ple images, each with separate data. ›Flowchart: Visually ordered sequence of images and annotations designed to tell a story. ›Comic strip: Sequence of frames containing images and text organized in a comic layout. ›Slideshow: Deck of slides combining images and text to sequentially tell a story. ›Film/video/animation: Motion graphics that incorporate data-driven imagery and visualiza- tions, often animated. However, as noted by Segel and Heer, their ﬁnd- ings are limited to a sample of 58 examples. They also do not claim that their genres are exhaustive, noting for example that their work did not include video games or e-learning tools. The seven genres have proven to be useful for categorizing research in this ﬁeld; they have even played a prescriptive role, with graph comics11and data comics12arising as examples of the comic strip genre, and data videos7drawing inspiration from ﬁlm/video/animation."

M7,The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Data-driven storytelling is a natural extension of visualization for explanation (the latter). Gershon and Page ﬁrst proposed using storytelling for visualization,14 and their work has since been followed up in workshops, surveys,3,15and even commercial tools. Vi /C19egas and Wat- tenberg remark upon the proclivity of visualization for communication by virtue of its graphical form, and encourage focusing on so-called communication- minded visualization10where communication enables social analysis. Finally, recent work by Brehmer and Kosara16widened the scope of data-driven storytelling to encompass a range of settings, from formal presenta- tions in front of stakeholders audiences ( “recitals ”)t o collaborative “jam sessions ”within the team. To reach its full potential, communication capabili- ties should be integrated into the visualization tools themselves; for example, Tableau incorporates bothslide stories as well as dashboards, and other tools provide similar functionality.

M7,The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization,1,1,narrative visualization,"This will help expand narrative visualization to encompass the entire scope of storytelling in society. This, in turn, would generate new ideas for how to best use such media for data-driven storytelling. Methodology Informed by Segel and Heer,3weﬁrst gathered candi- date examples from the literature by searching IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar for papers matching the search terms “data-driven storytelling ”and “narrative visualization. ”We then applied the inclusion criteria (story, data, novelty, and uniqueness) from the previous section to select a set of representative examples. Both authors were involved in this process and both had to agree to include each paper. Given our methodology, while we do not claim that our corpus is exhaustive, we think that it is diverse and representative. Based on our survey of the existing evidence of a wide variety of media for data-driven storytelling, we derived multiple candidate dimensions for classifying the different methods. We then selected ﬁve dimen- sions based on their ability to discriminate between storytelling media that are qualitatively different. In summary, we ended up with the following dimensions. ›Audience cardinality (A): Who is the intended recipient for the story? Motivation: Different media are suitable for different audiences; for example, a private conversation works best for a small set of people. ›Space and time (S/T): What is the temporal and spatial delivery mechanism for the story?"
M7,The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"Space and time has the following two values, one for each dimension. ›Space: relative physical locations of storyteller and recipient. –Co-located (coloc): the storyteller and the recipi- ent are in the same physical space (such as a presenter giving an in-person talk). –Distributed (distr): the storyteller and the recip- ient are not in the same physical space (such as a presenter giving a remote talk over Zoom). ›Time: temporal locations of storyteller and recipient. –Synchronous (sync): the storyteller is delivering the story to the recipient in real time (such as a presenter giving a live talk). –Distributed (distr): the storyteller is delivering the story in a form that the will be consumed by the recipient at a later time (such as playing back a recorded talk).Media Components The nature of the media captures the composition of the media being used for data-driven storytelling. Since we are typically talking about composite media types, the MC is a set variable for one or several of the following. ›Audio (aud): audio (such as speech recordings, ambient noise, or sampled sound effects). ›Music (mus): ordered sound forming music. ›Photographs (pho): pixmap images. ›Live video (vid): animated pixmap images. ›Static graphics (gra): static vector graphics. ›Animation (ani): animated graphics. ›Text (txt): textual representations. Data Components The core purpose of a data-driven storytelling artifact is to convey data from the storyteller to the viewer. The form that this takes is captured in the DC dimen- sion. It is a set variable of the following values. ›Table (tab): data table representation. ›Map (map): geographic maps. ›Statistical graphics (stat): statistical graphics, such as barcharts, scatterplots, and linecharts. ›Discrete event visualization (event): event timelines.TABLE 1.

M7,The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"While this foundation has proven instrumental in the guiding the development of data-driven storytelling, their model is limited in scope and con ﬂates the delivery mechanism with the media used for the message. We believe our taxonomy provides a more comprehensive view of media for data-driven storytelling while still building on their foundational work. Using our taxon- omy, designers will be able to widen the horizon of data-driven storytelling. By providing a taxonomy with detailed dimensions, we explored the possible values for each dimension. By expanding the list of dimen- sions and dimensions values, we can also keep track- ing of the emerging media types. In particular, the terms and dimensions in our taxonomy provides a standardized vocabulary to use when discussing data- driven storytelling."
M7,The Stories We Tell About Data: Surveying Data-Driven Storytelling Using Visualization,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"We have already surveyed some examples of data-driven storytelling in games (or created through the use of games in what is known as Machinima ), and we think that there is signi ﬁcant potential for this in the future. In particular, games for education and/or games in augmented reality may be particularly fertile grounds for adoption data-driven storytelling. This points to an obvious limitation to our survey: that we do not go far enough. Our survey corpus is diverse and unique, but that is no guarantee that it is exhaustive or even complete. We think data-driven storytelling should be a constant work in progress, just like story- telling in general, and we look forward to seeing new and experimental innovations in the future. Let us close on Marshall McLuhan ’s famous note that “the medium is the message. ”27It is clear that the medium used to convey a story will also affect the message and content of that story. This is not only true because the medium we choose affects the audi- ence that will be able to consume it, but also that the unique aspects of the medium gives speci ﬁc capabili- ties to the storyteller. We look forward to seeing how the data-driven storytelling community will explore such novel media in the future. CONCLUSION We have proposed a taxonomy of media for data- driven storytelling for the purpose of widening the dis- course on which storytelling techniques can be used for telling stories about data. Our work began with a survey of the wide range of evidence of such novel data-driven stories, resulting in us identifying several representative dimensions to categorize these media types. We then de ﬁned our taxonomy and used it to classify a large collection of novel data stories. Based on these ideas, we propose several novel applications for data-driven storytelling, and then close this article with some takeaways for designers looking to expand their repertoire in this domain. f[Online].

M10,HuCETA: A Framework for Human-Centered Embodied Teamwork Analytics,1,1,data storytelling,"This article presents a framework to support the development of human-centered embodied teamwork analytics by 1) enabling hybrid human –machine multimodal sensing; 2) embedding educators ’and experts ’knowledge into computational team models; and 3) generating human-driven data storytelling interfaces for re ﬂection and decision making. This is illustrated through an in-the-wild study in the context of healthcare simulation, where predictive modeling, epistemic network analysis, and data storytelling are used to support educators and nursing teams. Individuals who demonstrate effective teamwork and communication skills are in high demand across all professional sectors.1High-stakes sec- tors, such as healthcare and emergency response (e.g., see Figure 1 (top), are particularly susceptible to underdeveloped teamwork skills, where if teamwork issues are not addressed, wrong decisions may lead to people getting injured or even death.2It is thus of great importance for education providers to produce graduates who are equipped with the skills that mem- bers of high-performing teams require. Making evidence of teamwork activity available for learning and assessment has been proposed as an effective way to encourage team members to re ﬂect on their own experiences to learn from them.3Yet, in practice, educators, coaches, and team members commonly have sparse evidence to re ﬂect upon.4Cre- ating spaces equipped with sensors and input devicescapable of automatically capturing multimodal behav- ioral traces of collocated team activity can potentially be used to assess it for the purposes of learning, reﬂection, and coaching.5These traces can range from low-level logs, such as click-streams, to nonmedi- ated human actions, such as body positioning, manip- ulation of objects, and gestures."

Input: Human Logging To provide context for the analysis, task designers and educators de ﬁnedﬁvecritical actions that an effective team should accomplish promptly, namely: 1) adminis- tering oxygen after the patient had respiratory depres- sion; 2) assessing vital signs every 5 min; 3) ceasing PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) after the patient had altered conscious state; 4) activating Medical Emergency Team (MET) calls after the patient started deteriorating; and 5) administering Naloxone after- wards. While these actions can be performed by indi- vidual team members, it is the effective coordination, communication, and timeliness of such actions that enable the differentiation between high and low per- forming teams. These actions, which were too complex for automated logging, were logged by a researcher either in real time or post-hoc using a web-based log- ging interface that injected the logs as a new column per team member into the multimodal matrix."

Then, the user can select the actions, phases in the team activ- ity, or constructs that need to be considered in the modeling.

Figure 3(c) presents two additional data stories, one highlighting an error that the team made (top) and another showing a critical action performed correctly (bottom). Both interfaces have a self-explanatory title headlining the primary message (Figure 3(v); elaborated by the feedback nar- rative crafted by the educator to explain strengths/ weaknesses (vi). Moreover, the data stories both high- light (vii) and directly annotate (viii) relevant data points, in this case, the critical actions that were used by the rule-based algorithm con ﬁgured by the educa- tor to create each story. In prior works, we have evalu- ated high- ﬁdelity prototypes of these explanatory visual analytics, and gained evidence that students were positive about the potential of these data sto- ries.19In our most recent evaluation with 41 nursing students who engaged with a fully automated versiondescribed here, we corroborated that students used the data stories as evidence to re ﬂect on their prior performance. For example, some students realized that the team did not react as promptly as they recalled. The data stories also supported them to for- mulate strategies to address weaknesses in their com- munication and performance. In addition to Studies 1 and 2, empirical evaluations of user interface prototypes show that data storytell- ing can drive visual attention to the key details in a visualization;15that visualizations of nurses ’position- ing provided educators with insights that helped them differentiate good from poor teams13; and that the data stories [Figure 3(c)] helped students to identify misconceptions, strategize improvements to address errors, and re ﬂect on their arousal levels.19 DISCUSSION Our experiences in designing and deploying the two studies in our case study have brought to light three overarching themes related to improving future human-centered teamwork analytics. Synergy Between Human Intelligence and AI In Ben Shneiderman ’s17view, “computer scientists should build devices to enhance and empower —not replace humans. ”From a human-centered AI perspec- tive, our HuCETA framework blends the strengths of humans, sensing technologies, and AI. This can be seen as an example of the emerging research area called hybrid human-arti ﬁcial intelligence, which acknowledges that both human intelligence and AI each have their own strengths and limitations.20In our approach, educational stakeholders retain super- visory control of the analytics to imbue data with meaning, in order to create data stories that end-users can actually understand, and connect meaningfully to the coaching or learning purposes for the teams. Hence, removing full autonomy of the system is deliberate. Through our QE and data storytelling approaches, we make the most of the key capabilities of com- puters, which are ef ﬁcient in continuously gathering large amounts of data via sensors, and effective in dis- covering patterns from large datasets. These are har- nessed to amplify the capabilities of educators or coaches by providing ways for them to 1) make their assumptions, inferences and interpretations about teamwork explicit and trackable as streams of multi- modal data ( ﬁrst HuCETA component); 2) indicate to the computer how to interpret sensor data by applying 46 IEEE Pervasive Computing January-March 2023HUMAN-CENTERED AI Authorized licensed use limited to: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

M10,HuCETA: A Framework for Human-Centered Embodied Teamwork Analytics,1,1,data stories,"QE principles (second component); and 3) assist the computer to present analytics/AI-enabled feedback as intelligible data stories (third component). The Potential of Data Storytelling We received consistent positive feedback from both educators and students, who recognized the value of capturing digital traces of collocated activity and ren- dering it visible as explanatory, data stories for the pur- pose of provoking re ﬂection on team simulation experiences.19They also recognized the value of cap- turing both objective (via sensors) and subjective (via human observers) evidence about teamwork, in contrast to the current educational situation, where reﬂective team debriefs dependent on the expert observations by coaches or educators (often split over multiple teams), and the (often stressed, and always biased) memories of students. While some participants in our studies were inter- ested in the potential of the approach to assess team performance summatively , others expressed concerns about the risk of false negatives in the data stories. Multimodal data stories can certainly introduce bias in the way narrative is added to the visualizations [com- ponent (iii) in the framework], how rules to map low- level data into higher order constructs are created [component (ii)], and how accurately sensors or humans capture data [component (i)]. Although false negatives were not identi ﬁed in any of our prototypes (partly because of the close involvement of the research team), we concur with a more cautious view focused on formative feedback to guide deeper re ﬂec- tion and dialog, in which humans determine the ulti- mate meaning and actions to perform. Fully automated grading is signi ﬁcantly beyond the current maturity of this infrastructure. Advancing Team Science Versus Supporting Users The proposed framework (instantiated in many explanatory interfaces, such as the data stories pre- sented in Study 2) can help educators and team mem- bers test and re ﬂect on teamwork constructs (deﬁned as hypotheses, assumptions, or beliefs). As we have emphasized, however, more complex explor- atory interfaces that invite users to explore the data can offer the potential to assist researchers in testing theories about what makes teamwork effective, and can support educators ’and coaches ’inquiry into their own practices, as illustrated in Study 1. The HuCETA framework, and the open source, modular architec- ture enabling its implementation, offer a new form of‘team science research platform ’, which we hope may accelerate research in embodied teamwork, whether for exploratory, descriptive analyses, or for the testing of hypotheses. CONCLUSION Both classic and current research on arti ﬁcial and human intelligence has envisioned the ‘expansion ’ of human capabilities as a coevolving process of people, computers, and networks to approach com- plex tasks."

We discuss opportunities and challenges for making people experience immersion when interacting with visual data stories. Even though visual data stories are an important means for communicating information, the extent to which viewers feel immersed in such stories has so far been hardly explored. In this chapter, we explore the concept of immersion in visual data stories from the viewpoint of related disciplines in which narratives play an important role. We pay special attention to games research, which shares a focus on graphics and interactivity with our context of visual data stories. From this exploration we derive research opportunities and challenges for immersion in visual data stories. Keywords: storytelling, immersion, data-driven narratives, narrative visualization, visualization 6.1. Introduction Visual data-driven stories are a powerful means for communicating informa- tion to a broad range of audiences. Practitioners such as data journalists are increasingly creating popular data-driven stories that have been described as attractive, absorbing, engaging, or immersive."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"This type of visual data story closely relates to movies and film in that the audience can watch but not interact but feels nevertheless “immersed” despite a lack of mouse or touch-based interaction. Others have explored hybrid approaches allowing the audience to get involved in a scripted data story. For example, in “The Fallen of World War II” [ 20], a data story in the form of a narrated movie, the viewer can interrupt the story and interact with a chart that shows the deaths that occurred in WWII. With the advancement of mixed or virtual reality technology, practitioners have also started to tell stories by incorporating or mimicking real and virtual worlds. In 2015, Roger Kenny and Ana Asnes Becker (working for The Wall Street Journal at the time), for example, created a Virtual Reality (VR) visualization tour of c/circlecopyrtSpringer Nature Switzerland AG 2018 K. Marriott et al. (Eds.): Immersive Analytics, LNCS 11190, pp. 165–184, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01388-2 _6 the financial crisis of 2007 [25]."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"The authors aimed to create a data story that conveyed the data by evoking different feelings and experiences in the viewers [ 6]. The story unfolds as the viewer moves forward in time but stops at key moments on the Nasdaq variations. As in this piece, it is relatively common that immersive journalism uses 360◦videos to immerse their audience into a documentary. The aim of such techniques is to provide the audience with an auditory and visual experience that evokes people’s belief to be within the situation ."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"While these visual data stories above, as well as many others, have been described as immersive, the exact characteristics of an immersive data story remain elusive. In particular, it is most often not even clear what the experience of immersion into a data story would encompass. Do immersed viewers lose their sense of time when consuming data stories, feel particularly connected to the data, feel more broadly engaged, start to care about the data more, or any combinations of characteristics that have in the past been associated with an immersive experience? While researchers and practitioners are actively exploring the challenges and opportunities of narrative visualization, the challenge of creating an immersive data-driven story or narrative has so far received very little research attention. Yet, the concept of immersion has been extensively discussed in the context of different storytelling media. Unfortunately, these discussions often use different meanings and definitions of the term immersion itself, which leads to confusion with related terms including presence, engagement, perception of realism, addiction, suspension of disbelief, and flow [ 14]. In this chapter, we discuss how we can understand immersion in the context of visual data stories after briefly describing related work on storytelling with data-driven narratives. It is important to note that in these discussions we do not focus on any specific technology such as virtual or augmented reality. Instead, we discuss immersion as a concept that involves cognitive and emotional involvement, and derive a set of goals and research challenges based on this view of immersion. 6.2. Visual Data-Driven Stories Data-driven storytelling–also called narrative visualization–has become an active research direction within the domain of visualization [ 40]. Specifically, instead of focusing only on providing means for effective exploration and analysis of data, narrative visualization concerns effective explanation and presentation of data using visualization. The goal of visual data-driven stories (in short, visual data stories) is generally to reach a wide or targeted audience by putting together166 Isenberg et al. visualized findings or messages with connections such as temporal or causal relations [ 27,29]. In the past, there have been conceptual and theoretical research papers on the topic, work on specific storytelling techniques and methods, as well as work dedicated to specific storytelling genres or data types. 6.2.1. Understanding Data-Driven Narratives Dedicated research on storytelling with visualizations does not yet have a very long tradition."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"In 2010, Segel and Heer presented the first systematic study of the design space of narrative visualizations and categorized different genres, design elements, and narrative structures [ 40]. Similarly, the work by Hullman and Diakopolous focused on describing techniques for communicating an intended message with a visualization – with a focus on visualization rhetoric [ 22]. Both of these papers did not use a clear definition for a “visual story” or “data-driven visual narrative,” a point critiqued later by Lee et al. [29]. In their work, Lee et al. looked more closely at the process of creating data stories."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"The authors began by proposing three defining characteristics of a visual data story: visual data stories must include a set of facts backed by data (i. e., facts must be data-driven), most of these facts must be visualized to support an intended message (i. e., representation must be visual), and the visualization must include a meaningful order or connections that support the intended message (i. e., a story). As such, the presence of underlying data, an intended message, and a logical collection of supporting visualizations are key to distinguishing a visualization that is meant to tell a story from others that are meant to be used primarily for exploration and analysis. Lee et al. then proposed a working model for visual data storytelling process consisting of three main phases – explore data, make a story, and tell a story – to encompass the entire process of transforming data into visually shared stories. Chevalier et al. [15] later revised Lee et al. ’s process grounded by interviews with nine professionals who create visual data stories. The authors identified new roles including data collector and director as well as additional external factors including time and ethics. Researchers have also studied existing visual data stories to derive insights helpful for developing storytelling techniques and authoring tools. To better understand the effect of sequences in narrative visualization in order to develop an automatic sequencing algorithm, Hullman et al. conducted a focused analysis of transitions between scenes in 42linear, slide-show-style presentations [ 23]. Stolper et al. [43] performed a qualitative analysis of 45popular data stories and identified 20data-driven storytelling techniques grouped under four cate- gories: Communicating Narrative and Explaining Data, Linking Separated Story Elements, Enhancing Structure and Navigation, and Providing Controlled Explo- ration. In proposing the concept of “visual narrative flow,” McKenna et al. [32] systematically investigated 80stories found on popular websites, and identified seven “flow-factors” that can shape the flow of visual data-driven stories: naviga- tion input, level of control, navigation progress, story layout, role of visualization, story progression, and navigation feedback.Immersive Visual Data Stories 167 6.2.2. Techniques and Authoring Tools for Data-Driven Visual Stories Several researchers have proposed design considerations for visual data-driven stories of a particular style or for particular types of data. Amini et al. [1], for example, systematically studied 50professionally designed data videos to understand the structure and sequence designers commonly use to construct narrative visualization. After that, through a further analysis of an extended set of data videos, Amini et al. [2] identified a library of data clips that cover major components for creating compelling data videos. Similarly, Wang et al. [46] studied the use of animated narrative visualization for the presentation of video clickstream Data. Animation can also be used to highlight critical information in data stories. For example, Waldner et al. [45] studied how to guide the audience’s attention through a flicker in dynamic visualization. Bach et al. [3] studied comic-strip-style narrative visualizations to show changes in dynamic networks. The authors propose eight different design factors for creating this particular type of visual story, involving, for example, the visual representation of graph items, changes over time, or characters. Brehmer et al. [9] performed a survey of 263timelines to identify a design space for storytelling with timelines. The authors show that 20combinations of 14design choices lead to viable timeline designs that can be integrated into visual stories together with smooth animation."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"By analyzing a set of news articles related to the chart, contextifier can generate narrative visualization in an annotated chart style. Similarly, Ren et al. [35] focused on chart annotations in their survey of 106annotated chart images published by prominent news graphics. The authors’ survey led to the design of a system ChartAccent (Figure 2) that helps authors quickly and easily augment basic charts through a set of annotation interactions that generate manual and data-driven annotations. Wang et al. [47] proposed a narrative visualization system that helps researchers read academic papers by turning research paper into interactive slides. Researchers have also started to investigate ways to integrate exploration and presentation processes in narrative visualization tools. Gratzl et al. [19] propose the CLUE (Capture, Label, Understand, Explain) model that allows people to create a visual data story based on the history of the exploration; they can extract key steps, add annotations, and construct a story using the provenance data captured during the exploration process. Bryan et al. [12] present an approach that automatically creates and ranks data-driven annotations during the analysis to help people synthesize a coherent narrative with a temporal data summary.168 Isenberg et al. Fig.1: SketchStory attracts attention and creates anticipation using a real-time approach to content creation with pen and touch interaction. Fig.2: ChartAccent is a web-based authoring tool that enables people to augment charts using a palette of annotation interactions.Immersive Visual Data Stories 169 Due to the popularity of infographics, we are seeing an emergence of tools to facilitate their creation. Kim et al. [26] presented Data-Driven Guides, a technique to enable designers to generate guides from data and use them to accurately place and measure custom shapes. Hanpuku uses a bridge model that allows designers to bring their work back from the drawing tool (e. g., Adobe Illustrator) to re-edit in the generative tool (e. g., using D 3scripts) [ 7]. Researchers have also developed authoring tools to enable people with little or no programming skills to create a narrative visualization that supports interac- tions and animations. Ellipsis helps storytellers generate narrative visualization using templates with a domain-specific language (DSL) and a graphical user interface [ 39].TimeLineCurator automatically extracts temporal events from freeform text and enables people to interactively curate the events, helping them easily generate a linear timeline [ 18]. DataClips is an authoring tool that helps non-experts create data videos [ 2]. Timeline Storyteller (Figure 3) allows people to present different aspects of timeline data such as chronology, sequence and the periodicity of events using a palette of timeline representations, scales, and layouts, along with controls for filtering and annotation [ 10]. Fig.3: Timeline Storyteller enables people to create a scene-based story, presenting different aspects of timeline data using a palette of timeline representations, scales, and layouts."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"Defining Immersion in Visual Data Stories In the previous section, we introduced a large number of projects dedicated to narrative visualization or the creation of data-driven visual stories. None of these papers have specifically focused on immersive data-driven stories – in the general definition of immersion that we use in this book. So let us now more concretely discuss what we exactly mean by an immersive visual data story. In previous work, the term immersion has been used with various definitions depending on many factors such as the type of media referred to, the research domain, or the individual researchers who used it [ 14]. Much of this past work, however, has in common that immersion refers to a specific phenomenon that describes the experience a person has when engaging with a specific medium, such as a book, a movie, or a game. Immersion in the domain of visualization – narrative visualization in particular – has, however, not been clearly defined as a term that describes an experience. When ""immersion"" is used with the term ""visualization"" it most often refers to the fact that 3D visualizations are generated for viewing in virtual reality environments (e. g. [ 17,28,44]) and the focus of the work is more technical on how to achieve smooth renderings for these more complex technical setups or a multi-sensory experience. For example, previous work has investigated how virtual reality technology affects persuasion in data-driven storytelling [ 5]. The definition of immersion used in this paper followed Sanchez-Vives & Slater as [ 41]: “the technical capability of the system to deliver a surrounding and a convincing environment with which the participant can interact.” No evidence was found in this paper to support the benefits of using an immersive environment given this definition. We argue here, that this narrow view of immersion in visualization misses to point out many design opportunities and does not help us explain why some visualizations may capture viewers more than others. Before discussing how we use the term in this chapter and describing the experiences an immersive data story may want to create, we will take a look at the difficulty of defining the term in a related discipline: games research."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data storytelling,"We chose to focus on this particular context as it shares several characteristics with the specific data storytelling environments that we are ultimately interested in: both games and visual data stories are interactive and inherently graphical, they (often, but not always [ 13]) attempt to engage the player/viewer in a narrative, involve either open-ended or prescribed tasks to be accomplished that are often challenging, and mostly focus on non-stereoscopic presentation outside of VR – a technical focus we want to avoid in this book chapter. By relating our definition to games research, we do not, however, exclude experiences such as the Hans Rosling and Fallen of WWII examples described in the introduction, which both are less interactive and more movie-like. We will describe these data-driven stories using the same definition of immersion that we will choose for more interactive and open-ended data stories.Immersive Visual Data Stories 171 6.3.1. Immersion in Games For games research, Calleja [ 14] discusses how the almost interchangeable use of the terms immersion andpresence has been detrimental for research. The author details the varying uses of the term and proposes to distinguish between the absorption-sense of immersion andtransportation-sense of immersion . Theabsorption-sense of immersion refers to what Lombard and Ditton [ 31] call “psychological immersion:” a sense of involvement, absorption, engagement, and engrossment in a game."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data stories,"In addition, when players are kept wonderingImmersive Visual Data Stories 173 “what will happen next?” or “what will happen when I make a certain choice” they may become quickly engaged with a scripted narrative and their current alterbiography. In contrast to the ways of discussing immersion presented above, immersion can also be described as closely related to the concept of presence in a virtual environment. Some definitions of presence relate closely only to the availability of sensory input and output parameters. Zeltzer [ 48], for example, referred to it as a “lumped measure of the number and fidelity of available sensory input and output channels” – which is a much more technical definition than the “feeling of transportation” that other parts of the literature use."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"Viewers of a visual data story, for example, typically will not approach a visualization with the same incentives and goals; they will consequently have different expectations and preconceptions of a visualization than they would of a game. The two most important differences are, however, the frequent lack of a central character in a visual story to identify with and the story’s data being frequently based on not alterable non-fiction in contrast to the narratives of games that–even if based on historical events–can typically be influenced by the player to deviate from what truly happened in the past (changing their alterbiography). As such, we can be inspired by the discussions of immersion in game narratives when trying to define what it means for visual data stories but the relationships will be non-trivial.174 Isenberg et al. In general, the main goal for constructing a data story in the first place is effective communication of information or an intended message backed by data. We do not know how an immersive experience would affect the perception and retention of the depicted information. In order to begin studying the effects of immersion or designing for immersion, we need to be clear about the definition of immersion for data-driven visual stories. Following our discussions from above, we will begin by considering what it would mean if we considered immersion for visual data stories using the absorption- or transportation-sense of the term. Describing immersive data stories in the transportation-sense would require the data story to be spatially navigated or interacted with in an almost physical (or pseudo-physical) way. A few visualizations exist that allow this type of experience but generally, they are rarely built, distributed, and adopted. The roller coaster example from the Introduction Section is one example of a visualization that has been specifically built for storytelling and an immersive experience in the transportation-sense. There has been little past work on how setting up these types of environments affects a potentially immersive experience of a viewer or user."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"If we discuss immersive data stories using the absorption-sense of the term, we expect an immersive data story to engage and involve viewers or users to different degrees in the data story. These types of data stories can be two-dimensional visualizations found in online journalism, blogs, or newspaper articles, similar to the examples surveyed in the past [ 32,40,43]. Past research on narrative visualization has to a large extent focused on these types of data stories. Un- derstanding immersion according to the absorption-sense will ultimately require understanding how a viewer (or “user” if the stories are designed for interaction) cognitively experiences or synthesizes their experience with a narrative visual- ization. This experience, unfortunately, is something researchers still know very little about. Past research (see Section 6.2.) on storytelling with data has to a large extent considered the means by which a story can be communicated with data or the process by which data-driven stories can be created and largely only conjectured on the effects of storytelling elements on effective communication. The related work on immersive virtual reality visualizations has, perhaps, put the most emphasis on creating a specific absorption experience – primarily through effective rendering techniques and sensory input. However, as we discussed above, many more factors than the display environment can contribute to an immersive experience according to the absorption-sense. Previous research on immersion in narratives in other disciplines has, in addition, considered what makes a narrative immersive and even attempted to measure immersion."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data stories,"The other four dimensions seem more targeted to measuring precursors toImmersive Visual Data Stories 175 immersion: curiosity to explore the game narrative, concentration on the game, challenge and skills offered and required by the game, as well as a sense of control over the game narrative. Outside of games research, several authors have tried to extract what makes other types of media narratives immersive. In “The Art of Immersion” [ 36], Rose discusses how media has been changing and evolved to form new types of narratives and immersive experiences. The type of immersion he describes is different from the ones we discussed above."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"Given how others have attempted to define and describe immersion or immersion in narratives above, we can now begin by describing a set of goals we may want to achieve by an immersive visual data story. The following list is meant to expand upon other similar immersive experiences that can be evoked by a visualization or analysis environment – such as dissociation from the presence or feeling of being “in the data” – see for example Chapter 1. Concentrating solely on immersion in a data story, we may want to achieve: –A feeling of being closely connected to the data story and its intended message. –An emotional reaction to the message. This emotional reaction can be a positive or negative one, including anger or sadness about the depicted content, or a feeling of surprise and joy about the data;176 Isenberg et al. –An urge to deeply explore and “get lost” in the data story, a deep engagement or engrossment with the components of the data story. Given what we have reviewed above, we advocate to take a wide view of the term immersion in visualization and follow Cairns et al. [13] in proposing a wide definition for the field of visualization: Immersion in visualization is the engagement or involvement someone feels as the result of looking, exploring, or analyzing a visual data representation. Given their goals and ours, we propose to, in particular, consider immersion in visual data stories as an experience that involves a sense of absorption leading to deep involvement, engagement, and engrossment with the data. Many additional factors discussed above can lead to this kind of immersion, such as a social presence, internal synthesis, emotional connection, or a feeling of transportation into the data-world. It will have to be explored which factors influence immersion in visual data stories and the list of research projects to engage in this realm is still vast. 6.4. Research Opportunities in Immersive Visual Storytelling with Data The three goals listed in the previous section are central to what immersion in visual data stories can aim to achieve but other goals are certainly possible. In this section, we describe several opportunities and challenges that arise when we want to design immersive visual data stories that achieve these three goals. We present what we believe to be some of the most interesting research questions on this topic, but many more are possible and our list is certainly not complete. Each research question posed is also purposefully broad leading to a wide number of possible future research projects. How much reality is necessary?"
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data stories,"Perhaps storytelling elements that make connections to the “real-world” or the context of the data can help to make visual data-driven stories more immersive?Immersive Visual Data Stories 177 For example, many infographics contain images related to the context of the data, such as the four images of baseball players in the New York Time’s piece on steroid use in baseball: “Steroids Or Not, the Pursuit is On” reprinted by Segel and Heer [ 40]. Past research has shown that some form of embellishments to data charts can be helpful, e. g. for memorability [ 8]. Yet, how embellishments such as images, or pictograms can aid in storytelling and immersion has not yet been deeply researched. In addition, many other forms of connecting abstract data to the real-world data context are certainly possible as described in the three examples from the introduction."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data stories,"To which extent would the same be true for visual data stories? Also can, as previously conjectured, different types of displays such as large displays or CAVEs aid immersion in a visual story? Even if their goal is not to necessarily create a feeling of physical realism? What is the role of interaction in creating or hindering immersion?"
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"With a data-driven story this is potentially dangerous as it may allow people to insert rumors, personal beliefs and other non-data-driven content around an existing data story. Yet, the role of interaction can also be considered at a much lower level for individual data stories in which the type of interaction techniques need to be considered (e. g. mouse vs. touch), how much of the data can be manipulated, or which interaction hardware will be offered. Data visualizations often offer interactive capabilities to help people drill down on details that interest them. This type of free exploration can both help in creating an immersive experience of “getting lost in the data” but it can also break an emerging immersion when people have to search for interactions or cannot find their way back from detail 5http:/ /lostpedia .wikia .com178 Isenberg et al. views and undo their past exploration steps. What the right balance between fully interactive experiences, guided walkthroughs, or no interaction at all is for the creation of an immersive data exploration experience is so far unclear."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"As discussed above, an emo- tional reaction to a visual data story can be an important pre-cursor to immersion. Yet, how a deep emotional connection can be achieved for visualizations and in particular for data-driven visual stories is yet unclear. It can become in particular difficult since visualizations–unlike games–typically do not include specific charac- ters that viewers/users can attach to or feel empathy with or a “world” that they can be part of. It also needs to be considered what kinds of emotions one might want to evoke in the first place."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,storytelling with data,"Recently, Bartram et al. [4] studied affective color for visualization which is one step towards design elements for visualizations that can influence visual storytelling with data. More dedicated work in this direction could re-examine already proposed storytelling techniques for visualization and their potential influence on emotion, for example, how can the presentation of annotations lead to emotional involvement, would fonts, font sizes, and the type of writing influence how people emotionally react? Similarly, other storytelling techniques could be re-examined. What are levels of immersion in visual data stories? As discussed above, immersion is not a binary experience that is either present or not. Immer- sion has been described as an experience along a continuum, for example, from people feeling simply engaged, to feeling fully absorbed in the medium. It is not clear to which extent this continuum will be present in immersive experiences around data visualization."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data stories,"Which past definitions of the immersion continuum would most relate to how people experience visual data stories? Would Brown and Cairns’ [ 11] engagement, engrossment, and total immersion in games research make sense to apply? Or would Ryan’s [ 38] immersion continuum from concentra- tion, imaginative involvement, entrancement, to addiction in literary texts make more sense? In general, more research is necessary to see how concepts of immer- sion from other research fields apply to visual stories."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data stories,"In addition to theoretical assessment of the remaining literature, it is, thus, important to derive ways for measuring immersion.Immersive Visual Data Stories 179 What are the effects of immersion on the viewer? All research ques- tions above hinge to some or even a large extent on the question of how to measure immersion for visual data stories. Some related work has attempted to study immersion through questionnaires, and there is related work in brain-computer interfaces that has looked at studying components of immersion such as concen- tration or emotion/affect (e. g. [ 16]). This past work may be a good starting point to attempt to measure immersion in visualization before more dedicated research methodologies can be developed or adapted from existing techniques. Studying immersion is important as many interesting questions are open as to the effects of immersion on the viewer."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data story,"Will an immersive visual data story aid visualizations to be more memorable, will viewers retain more information, will they learn better, will they be better persuaded to act? In addition, the research questions raised above hinge to a large extent on the possibilities to measure immersion. What are potential dangers for immersive visual stories? Finally, it is not clear to which extent it is even desirable to create an immersive visual data story. If viewers become so immersed that they stop to question the data, where it comes from, and what it might want to say, this can be potentially dangerous. In addition, it is possible that people want to make a visual story their own and synthesize it as they please. Could immersion help to lead people on the right path?"
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data stories,"Conclusion Visual data stories bring us a powerful means for communicating information to a range of audiences. In this chapter, we discussed immersion in the context of visual data stories. We first presented an overview of how immersion has been discussed in the related literature, focusing on a definition of immersion for visual data stories that is inspired by previous descriptions of the absorption- sense of immersion. We propose to begin research on the concept of immersion in visualization with a broad definition: Immersion in visualization is the engagement or involvement someone feels as the result of looking, exploring, or analyzing a visual data representation . This type of immersion can involve many factors such as a deep sensory experience in VR environments, an emotional connection to the data and its main message, a feeling of social presence, or even transportation into the data world. Not all of these factors will be necessary to create this feeling of immersion and much research has to be conducted to understand the role of these and other factors in creating immersive data visualization experiences."
BC1,Immersive visual data stories,1,1,data stories,"In this book chapter, we focused in particular on challenges and opportunities for immersive data stories. We hope that our work will inspire others to start their180 Isenberg et al. own projects in this direction as the research questions on this topic are still wide open.

BC2,Pedagogical and Future Implications for the Training of Data Translators,1,1,data stories,"Woolford  Abstract Sharing data stories is an exciting opportunity for integrating data into the  workplace. The examples provided in the chapters of this book reveal three imper-atives for training data translators: 1) interdisciplinarity, 2) a knowledge exchange  framework (KEF), and 3) language calibration. We propose that a focus on devel-oping students’ skills in these areas must be coupled with data science training if we  are to prepare effective data translators. Instructors must look to adjust not just their methods, but the philosophy behind their instruction to train students for the next generation of data translation jobs."
BC2,Pedagogical and Future Implications for the Training of Data Translators,1,1,data stories,"In the chapters of this book, we have  gathered a variety of examples demonstrating how such data stories can be created  and taught to new generations of data scientists and, most especially, those who aspire to using the wealth of data available yet who lack as strong a background in data  science and analytics. It is this group—those we call data translators—who navigate the shifting boundaries between disciplinary expertise and data science, interpreting data in meaningful and accurate ways for others. How can we teach new generations of data translators to navigate these bound- aries? The case studies in this book suggest three factors need attention."
BC3,Information Visualization: Features and Challenges in the Production of Data Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"Though the concept was introduced more than ten years ago by Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer in the seminal work Narrative Visualization: T elling Stories with Data (2010), Narrative Visualization is still an emerging genre. The concept encapsulatescomplex data’s effective communication to an audience engagingly using visualiza- tion and promoting insights, with a structured or semi-structured interpretation path [18]. Segel and Heer [ 34] identiﬁed three narrative structure tactics used in visualiza- tion. The ﬁrst was ordering, which refers to the ways of systematizing the path users take through the visualization, and that can either be prescribed by the author (orlinear), have no path suggested at all (random access), or need the user to choose a path among multiple alternatives (user-directed)."
BC3,Information Visualization: Features and Challenges in the Production of Data Stories,1,1,narrative visualization,"Although it has been used in information visualization with severalpurposes, the more common being (1) making the data more engaging or playful and (2) showing the data in manageable portions (by partitioning it, either by browsing or by querying), for narrative visualization, interactivity opened up the possibility ofadding new layers of content. These layers of content are vital for visualizations to act as stand-alone narrative news pieces. Visualizations can, thanks to this added tier of content added most of the time in the form of annotations, present content that adds context, in addition to the data itself. This content’s potential as a means to help a user make sense of the data is vast [22]."
BC3,Information Visualization: Features and Challenges in the Production of Data Stories,1,1,data-driven storytelling,"In 2016, as an outcome of a workshop on Data-Driven Storytelling in Dagstuhl, an interactive browsable collec- tion of narrative design patterns with examples was created. According to Bach andcolleagues [ 2:111], “a narrative pattern is a low-level narrative device that serves a speciﬁc intent”. In NAPA Cards 1the 16 patterns (Incorporating the audience, Repeti- tion, Juxtaposition, Breaking the fourth wall, Humans behind the dots, Make a guess,Rhetorical question, Familiar Setting, Call to action, Gradual visual reveal, Defamil- iarization, Convention breaking, Speeding up, Concretize, Meaningful use of space and Silent data) are grouped into ﬁve higher-level pattern groups: empathy/emotion,engagement, framing, ﬂow and argument/argumentation. This typology derived from an initial open-ended question regarding the purpose of the use of narrative, the existing patterns, and its application."

The main motivation is that citizens or compa- nies use these datasets and develop new data products and applications by either enriching their existing data stores or by smartly combining datasets from various open data portals. In this chapter, we ﬁrst describe the development of open data over the last few years and brie ﬂy introduce the open data portals of the USA, the EU, and Switzer- land. Next we will explain various methods for information visualization."
BC5,Narrative Visualization of Open Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"In particular, we show how we developed visualization applications on top of the Swiss open data portal that enable web-based, interactive information visualiza- tion as well as a novel paradigm —narrative visualization. 1 Introduction to Open Data The idea of freely sharing open data has been around for several decades. For instance, the World Data Center1developed a concept for open access to scienti ﬁc data in 1957 –58. However, the open data movement for access to public data has only recently gained worldwide traction (Bauer and Kaltenböck 2011 ). One of the main drivers of the movement2is Tim Berners-Lee, who is often considered as the father of the World Wide Web."

Data visualization supports users in intuitively exploring the content of data, identifying interesting patterns, and fosters sense-making interpre- tations. Starting with a table of numbers is not an ef ﬁcient way of interpreting data — an experience that is also commonly expressed in the idiom “a picture is worth a thousand words. ”Complex information can only be slowly digested from rows of tabular data. By using graphical representations, we leverage the fact that our visual perception and our human cognition processes are more effective (Ware 2012 )."
BC5,Narrative Visualization of Open Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"Documenting the discovery of insights by guiding users through data landscapes is supported by narrative visualization techniques (Segel and Heer 2010 ). By presenting curated data exploration, users can step through a story, but also interactively explore the underlying datasets to gain their own insights. Data-driven journalism applies narrative visualization to present254 P. Ackermann and K. Stockinger interactive visual stories. A good, illustrative example that was produced by Bloomberg is shown in Figs. 14.2 and14.3."

Applications using interactive and narrative visualizations need custom development of speci ﬁc software to present ﬁndings to end users. To reach many users, such visual presentations are often deployed via the Internet or via an organization-speci ﬁc intranet. Development libraries for web-based interactive data visualization such as Shiny6(Beeley 2016 ) and d3.js7(Bostock et al. 2011 ) provide core visualization technologies and many examples in the continuum of the three data visualization types. 3 Data Visualization Work ﬂow The work ﬂow for developing data visualizations comprises several steps for data processing, information modeling, and presentation authoring (see Fig. 14.5). Although the work ﬂow process is mainly sequential, typically many iterations for reﬁning the deliverables are needed to create convincing data visualization results."
BC5,Narrative Visualization of Open Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"If narrative visualization is aimed to additionally achieve storytelling, anima- tions become part of the data visualization work ﬂow. 4 Visualization for Exploring Open Data By working through the data visualization work ﬂow, data visualization itself is used to iteratively improve the results. Visual representations of data are helpful in gaining insights and in making evidence-based decisions to reach a convincing information presentation. Data exploration and analysis tools such as Tableau8and QlikView9provide interactive environments to inexpensively run visual analytics on a variety of data sources. 8tableau.com 9qlik.com14 Narrative Visualization of Open Data 257 The content of open data sources is often represented as relational tables in a database. In order to get familiar with an unknown database, Waser ( 2016 ) devel- oped a visualization tool for SQL databases (see Fig. 14.6) to visually explore the structure and the content in parallel. The tables of the database are visually arranged in a circular layout showing the relations between tables that are color-encoded as arcs. Selecting tables and/or relations in the visual diagram automatically generates queries with corresponding joins."

Before the data was visualized, several data preprocessing steps were required. In our case, we used the CKAN API provided by the Swiss open data platform to access the data. This API gives access to the metadata about the datasets, such as data owner, time of upload, description about the datasets, etc."
BC5,Narrative Visualization of Open Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"The added value of interactive narrative visualization is that users can follow different lines of thought in a story by interacting with the visualized content.14 Narrative Visualization of Open Data 259 In order to develop the visualization stories, we applied an iterative development process of using data visualization for exploring and ﬁnding relevant correlations. Additionally, we enriched the interactivity with storytelling aspects resulting in a guided user experience.10 In order to meaningfully interpret visualized data, it is helpful to present chosen information in a way that comparison between some grouping and/or within a historical, time-dependent context is supported.

Even though there is a vast amount of open data available, the datasets are typically loosely coupled collections of data items. Moreover, the datasets have very heterogeneous data formats and often lack a description of metadata. Hence, before data can be visualized, it often needs to be manually transformed, harmonized, cleaned, and brought into a common data model that allows easy visualization. Visualization technology : Recently, there has been a vast amount of visualiza- tion methods developed as part of the D3.js framework that enables quick prototyping."
BC5,Narrative Visualization of Open Data,1,1,narrative visualization,"As a consequence, inter- active information visualization and especially narrative visualization often require a development path from rapid prototyping using “out-of-the-box ”data graphics toward “customized ”visualizations that require some design and coding efforts. 7 Conclusions The information visualizations shown in this chapter exemplify the bene ﬁto f gaining insight via interactive graphical presentations using open data available from public health authorities. In general, our society demands more transparency14 Narrative Visualization of Open Data 263 (Taylor and Kelsey 2016 ). Open data coupled with information visualization will increasingly become an attractive way to communicate fact-based interrelations in economic, social, and political contexts. The awareness is increasing that it is important to provide open data to the public. Even so, it is relevant that the growing information available as open data becomes accessible via interactive visualizations in order to manage the growing complexity we are confronted with."

The creator of the visualization should be aware of the content of the book so that the visualization can be created accurately. The tutor should consider the followingpoints while creating a storyboard: (i) The content which the tutor wants to convey should be converted into accurate visualization format which otherwise will convey wrong meaning. (ii) The important points of the content should be highlighted using appropriate colour, size, boldness and connecting elements like arrows and shaded trails should be properly maintained which otherwise will create trouble to the user. (iii) The images should be aligned from the largest image to the smallest image with the appropriate caption given to them. The images should also have proper sizeand should be positioned in appropriate place so that content can be conveyed in proper manner.

T o conclude our workshop, small groups collaborate on a larger project that brings  together our explorations in data, design, and storytelling. Working in skills-based teams, participants brainstorm and prototype a data story  over the ﬁ  ve-day workshop—speciﬁ  cally, an interactive narrative experience that  tells a story with/around/about data. Options for groups include:     •  Research project (new or ongoing).    •  Data visualization.    •  3D sculpture.    •  Interactive documentary.    •  Online exhibition or installation.    •  Data mural.    •  Archive project.    •  App (or prototype for an app).    •  Informational website/resource.    •  Grant proposal (for example, NEH ODH).    •  Article or web-text.    •  Scholarly panel proposal for a conference.    •  Pedagogical/scholarly resources, class activities, syllabus.

Tools and methods  of analysis come later, once we know the question that’s driving the story.    •  In storytelling, it’s imperative to show the affective dimensions of data.    •  A design-driven story means that you have to choose the right tool to com- municate with your audience but not let the tool drive your story.

B2,Storytelling with data: let's practice,1,1,data stories,"In our data stories, it can take  the form of additional detail or further breakdown (here’s how the tension  plays out by product or region), or could be potential options you’ve weighed,  solutions you may employ, or discussion you’d like to facilitate among your  audience. •	Ending: This is the resolution, the call to action. The ending is what your au - dience can do to resolve the tension that you’ve brought to light. Note that it  isn’t typically so simple as “We found X; therefore you should do Y.” Our data  stories are often more nuanced than that. This ending could be a conversation  you want to drive, options to choose from, or perhaps even input you need  from your audience to fully ﬂesh out your story."

That  first grant funded our 'BU Datalabs' training project in 2015 leading to many  more small pockets of funding, partnerships, and creative enterprises. Together these enabled us to grow from an initial idea into an internation­ ally recognised Civic Media Hub. Thanks to the early dreamers who helped envision the Civic Media Hub:  Einar Thorsen, Phillipa Gillingham, Duncan Golicher, Edward Apeh and Dan  Jackson."

Thanks also to Karen Fowler-Watt, Shelley  Thompson and Julian McDougall for their unwavering support through  all we've tried to manifest, including this workbook. Tom Sanderson from the Centre for Investigative Journalism has offered  invaluable insight, energy and access to an amazing network of passion­ ate practitioners, many of whom are featured here. Omega Research  Foundation and Public Health Dorset, we are so grateful for our adven­ tures in data storytelling that now fill these pages. Thanks are also due to Routledge, and particularly Niall Kennedy, who  invited us to dream up a textbook unlike other textbooks. Before leaving  Routledge Niall made it possible for us to co-create this workbook with  our hugely talented and incredibly collaborative graphic design studio  Minute Works. Partnering with Jimmy Edmondson and Dom Latham has  not only led to five years of beautiful data storytelling artefacts, but also  to seeing research as inseparable from how we visually communicate it to empower audiences. A huge thank you goes to everyone around the world who hosted us,  partnered with us, let us do weird things at your events, encouraged our  experiments and reminded us time and again that it is ok to break the  moulds, challenge the canons, and refuse the silos of academia. Finally, this workbook would not be possible without our students. Teach­ ers are only able to be as imaginative as their pupils and institutions allow."

Alongside  this, digital transformations in communications have led to the increas­ ing popularity of infographics, data visualisations, and the use of maps  for representing data and communicating its significance. But while  datasets and digital archives grow bigger and more open, information  remains difficult to collect, complex to analyse, and challenging to com­ municate. As we’ve seen over the past two decades of this proliferation, more data does not necessarily lead to better data stories. Responding to these recent changes, a wide range of industries and or­ ganisations, from academia to journalism, from health care to city coun­cils, find themselves increasingly wanting to communicate more effec­ tively—and more empathetically—with data. This has led to the demand  for more professionals trained to engage with data in innovative ways. Likewise, an increased emphasis on visual communication techniques  needed to create engaging infographics and maps has brought greater attention to the importance of visual storytelling for impacting audiences."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Perhaps the earliest adopters of this contemporary wave of data storytell­ ing were journalists. When The Guardian’s data blog launched in 2009, it paved the way for data-driven storytelling on an international scale. As  these early adopters have argued, while spreadsheets and data visualis­ ation tools allow us to discover stories, they “do little to aid narrative com­munication of these findings to others” (Segel and Heer, 2010, p. 1139). In other words, a better-looking bar chart is not enough to effectively  bring information to audiences. Storytelling with data involves combining  visual and narrative forms of communication. Beyond journalism, this data storytelling approach is increasingly being  used in health communications. Research has found that storytelling  is particularly important when visual presentation is used as part of a  medical decision-making process. Here the “succinct presentation of im­portant facts is crucial” (Kosara and Mackinlay, 2013, p. 50). As medical  information is often dense and complicated, data storytelling is proving  to be an excellent way to connect with patients, break down communi­ cation barriers, and give people more ability to navigate and discuss their  health and wellbeing. At the Bournemouth University Civic Media Hub our approach is to begin  from the basics. As we teach our students, colleagues, industry clients,  and community partners, it is important to develop basic understandings  of storytelling in order to communicate more effectively—and empathet­ ically—with data. At the same time, we believe that to tell better data sto­ 002           ries one must also take a reflective approach as to what data is, where it  comes from, and why this matters for evidence-based storytelling."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Through workshops and  public events, we take a participatory approach to data storytelling that  combines principles of design, narrative theory, scaffolded technology  learning, and hacklab-style collaborations. Over the past five years we have put on over 50 local, national, and in­ ternational events; given dozens of talks around the world; and created  infographics, interactive websites, data comics, policy reports, media  tool kits, beer mats, and even a board game! Pushing the boundaries of traditional data visualisation, our approach to data storytelling embraces  all kinds of creative forms. Our aim is not to make a prettier pie chart or more advanced network analysis visualisation. Rather, our goal is to get people talking, feeling, and thinking critically about data through the use  of evidence-based storytelling. Stories are thought to be one of the oldest forms of human communica­ tion."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"For those  who like a definition, this is our vision of data storytelling:  Data stories are intentional communicative artefacts that present data  in an interesting, evocative, and informative way.  003  As Professor Jennifer L. Aaker (2013) says, “When data and stories are  used together, they resonate with audiences on both an intellectual and  emotional level.”       Before we raise too many eyebrows, it is important to state clearly that our  goal in introducing storytelling and narrative technique to data commu­ nication is not about dramatising or embellishing for the sake of a more  engaging story. We are not after the best spin or selling points. Rather,  our aim is to focus on the human elements of what is in a dataset in order  to be able to more clearly pinpoint what is at stake, and to communicate  it effectively and empathetically to our audiences."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Rather, the aim of this workbook is to cul­ tivate the mind-sets needed for you to become a better data storyteller. Becoming a Data Storyteller  When researchers write an academic article they often provide an ac­ count of the steps they took to conduct their project. The structure of the  paper takes the reader through their process, showing how a conclusion  was reached. This writing style is often compared to a recipe or roadmap. Clear signposting, as we say to our students, helps others follow along."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Yet, many barriers remain  to establishing more robust data storytelling education programmes in  schools, universities, and professional workplaces. Challenges to Data   Storytelling Education  A range of provisions for data storytelling development currently exist  to teach students and professionals about data storyteling. There are  online resources (Google tutorials, web scrapers, Stack Exchange); in­ troductory classes ( Guardian Masterclasses, CIJ Summer School); and  software training (Excel, Tableau). However, our own experience of train­ ing, alongside research evidence, suggests that these provisions alone  are not enough for creating a culture of data storytellers (Demirkol et al.,  forthcoming; Feigenbaum et al., 2016; Stoneman, 2017). Even when people are able to attend training classes online and offline,  skill development and retention is difficult without regular engagement. Like learning a language, without the ability to practise everyday conver­ sation, skills get lost. Trainers find that the same people are attending  their introductory classes each year (Stoneman, 2017) and people report that the daily demands of their jobs, limited support structures, and a lack  of confidence inhibit their ability to advance their data skills (Demirkol et  al., forthcoming)."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"At the heart of developing data storytelling education is the task of bal­ ancing truth, accuracy, and transparency with engaging narratives. At the  same time, it is crucial that we educate ourselves and the next genera­ tion not just to tell data stories, but to tell them responsibly. Hewett (2016)  argues that higher education institutions have been slow to incorporate  digital training and the rise of data journalism into their curriculum. Simi­ larly, in public and third sector organisations, there is often little—if any—  resources or time available for professional development in data story­ telling. Where budget lines exist, one-off workshops are usually the go-to,  resulting in a lack of skills retention or workplace capacity building in data  storytelling. While industry publications continue to call for these skills to  be developed, as outlined in reports from Nieman Lab, journalism.co.uk,  and PBS MediaShift, the formal adoption of data storytelling education remains limited (Hewitt, 2016). This workbook is our contribution to the  development of a more robust data storytelling education for everyone.  005                A Guide to Using   this Workbook  In this workbook we will introduce you to basic concepts in visual and  narrative storytelling and explore how they might help transform the  ways you communicate with data. Likewise, we will cover some of the  foundational terminology and concepts in working with data, data visual­ isation, and mapping, highlighting our storytelling approach throughout. By drawing together practitioner perspectives across a range of different  sectors, from rural cartography to human rights campaigning, this work­ book explores the different practices and techniques that contemporary  data storytellers use. Focused around the importance of reflective and  sustainable collaborations, we try to offer language lessons that can help  foster communication between people involved in telling data stories, from computer scientists to social theorists to social media marketers. Rather than focus on specific software or tools, this workbook focuses  on the resources, skills, and mind-sets needed to turn ideas into commu­ nicative artefacts. Underpinned by cross-disciplinary research, as well as projects that in­ spire us, the bulk of this workbook comes from our experiences working  together at the BU Civic Media Hub. Many of the examples we draw on  and showcase come from work produced by and with our collaborators."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"While there are thousands of other examples from  around the world we could have chosen to illustrate our points, we decid­ ed to spotlight those that are closer to our hearts, enabling us to share  not just the shiny outcomes of data storytelling projects, but the chal­ lenging, exciting, occasionally sad and sometimes comical, collaborative  processes that led to their creation. This first-hand approach gives us a unique perspective, inviting you on a behind the scenes tour into our  world of making data stories together. Practically, the workbook features three main types of content: key con­ cepts, spotlights, and activities. These are illustrated on the next pages.   006           Key Concepts – These short write-ups define key concepts, techniques  and challenges in data storytelling.  → Like interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary   refers to work that crosses more than one   discipline or branch of knowledge. As these   different knowledges come together, a new,   more holistic knowledge base emerges. Some of the key concepts sections in this workbook will cover terms  you have heard a hundred times before, like ‘big data,’ while others are  meant to explore issues that don’t always get talked about explicitly when  putting together data stories. Our concept entries such as ‘Standpoints  Matter’ and ‘No Platform is Neutral’ discuss the difficulties of trying to  humanise data, including how we represent multiple perspectives when  giving narratives to numbers. Other key concepts like ‘Graphic Medicine’  and ‘Multisensory Data Viz’ are intended to introduce you to emergent areas that we think have a lot to offer our data storytelling practices. Data storytelling is a transdisciplinary field, informed by hundreds of  years of practice and theoretical reflection. The key concepts we’ve cho­ sen to highlight come from English, Geography, Data Science, Media  Studies, Art History, and Medical Humanities—to name only a few. Se­ lecting what to include often led to keyboard paralysis—hours of staring  at the contents spreadsheet hitting ‘delete row,’ ‘insert row.’ In the end,  what made it into the workbook were those terms and ideas that we kept  coming back to in our research, teaching, and practice. This does not mean that the concepts we have chosen are the most  important, or even the things that we think that everyone should know."

When we began this project we imagined 100 concepts and a handful  of spotlights. But as we began to pull together the ideas, images, people,  and projects that would make up the contents of this workbook, we dis­ covered something very important about our project. It was less about  what we know and more about who we have met along the way."

In addition to key concepts and spotlights, this workbook features ac­ tivities that you can use in classrooms, professional development train­ ings, or even on your own with friends and colleagues. All of the featured  activities have been tried and tested in our BU Civic Media Hub work­ shops, with our students, or by partner organisations.

While pull-ups and poppadums may not be essential for successful data  storytelling, an on-going commitment to collaboration is. For us, this  means committing to curiosity-driven work, clarity in mutual expecta­ tions, coordination of working practices, and care for how we treat each  other. We will discuss these Four Cs in more detail in the final chapter of  this workbook."

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"As a result, a team of professionals at the CRA have  begun developing a data storytelling workshop, cre­ ated because of expressed need within the organiza­ tion to enhance its data-driven culture. Taking inspira­tion from the work of geomorphologist John Phillips,  we would like to explore the specific forms that nar­ ratives/plotlines take in CRA’s Small and Medium En­ terprises Directorate’s (SMED) Business Intelligence  (BI) unit, and how they can be applied to the CRA con­ text. In his article “Storytelling in Earth Sciences: The  Eight Basic Plots” (2012), Phillips identifies the plot/  storylines that characterize the work of his discipline. He does so in order to highlight how disciplinary pref­ erences for different plot narratives in Earth Sciences  may result in different interpretations and conclusions  for similar events (evidence), and thus enhance criti­ cal thinking within geomorphology."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Data storytelling is not a method/methodology that  the quantitative researchers within the unit are famil­ iar with or have expressively used. But they have ac­ knowledged that they might benefit from a different  approach than the communicative conventions with­ in their own disciplines. In addition to introducing the  workshop audience to a variety of more convention­ ally used data storytelling formats/structures, we are attempting something slightly more innovative and  hopefully self/organizationally reflective. Our aim is to better understand how BI researchers  can more effectively communicate their findings us­ ing data stories that are common to their disciplines in a way that also recognizes the types of stories that  CRA decision makers (from backgrounds in account­ ing and administration etc.) have been using to com­ municate what is important to them. It is precisely the  intersection of these two sets of “story/plotlines” that may inform the kinds of communicative strategies  that will be most effective in addressing any ongoing  data communication needs within the agency. The first workshop, for BI researchers, elicits the plot/  storylines used within the BI research unit; while an­ other workshop, for managers and auditors (etc.), ex­ plores the kinds of stories and narratives that capture   the attention of decision makers within the organiza­tion. Each group will participate in exercises that will   encourage reflection upon their work and “tease” out   the major story themes and plotlines that captivate and   influence them."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"The results of the intersection of these   two sets of stories, “CRA story/plotlines,” is what will   help build the larger workshop material, as a potential   data storytelling structure, and ultimately benefit the   data-driven culture within the agency as a whole.

The next layer, information, re­ fers to the process that makes data meaningful, giving it a purpose or  context.

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"When we  teach people about structured data for data storytelling in our trainings,  we start by using a basic spreadsheet , with its neat rows and columns. Each column in the spreadsheet represents a category of information,  each row a unique entry, and each cell a discrete data point. Whether  you are working with numeric data like monetary values or tempera­ tures, or text data like a first name or descriptive word, a spreadsheet  provides a systematic structure for how your data is recorded. In contrast, unstructured data refers to data that is not organised in  a pre-defined way."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Rather, data points form part of a broader data storytelling process that brings us from pixels and pic­ tures to the story of a wedding. The more we zoom in on a data point, the more we see its complexity,  while the more we zoom out, the more we see its context. When present­ ing data, the goal is to zoom in enough to realistically relate complexity,  while zooming out enough to give the context the audience needs to un­ derstand its potential meanings and significance. This is even more per­ tinent when the aim of telling your data story is to create an intervention  or a call to action. In these instances it is also often crucial to reach your  audience emotionally. But in order to provoke your audience to think, to  feel, or to do, first you must understand them. Understanding your Audience   What makes us compelled to tell a story?"
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"Or maybe you tell data stories simply b e cause it is what you are  paid to do. Regardless of why you tell stories with data, for them to be  effective, they need an audience. As author J.K. Rowling once said, “No  story lives unless someone wants to listen” (Treneman, 2003)."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"Imagining  who that eager listener might be can help shape your data stories and  motivate you to keep working on a project. John Steinbeck famously ad­ vised aspiring authors to pick one person, real or imagined, and write to  them. Before starting any data storytelling project, we always think first about  audience. Recently we have started to use a simple activity to link story  to audience. The task is called ‘Think, Feel, Do’ and is adapted from Su­ san O’Halloran’s (2014) communications training for the non-profit sector. O’Halloran writes that stories are told for specific reasons. “When you  think of your communication objective, you’re really asking two ques­tions:  1."

At the same time, specificity is key for  effective—and efficient—data storytelling. Editors I’ve worked with often complain that too many proposals and pitches state that an author’s tar­get audience is ‘the general public.’ “There is no such thing as a general  public,” these editors say. Instead, editors want their prospective authors  to be more specific about the different kinds of audiences they imagine themselves writing for. It is only when we are specific about our audience  segments that we can begin to tell stories more effectively."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"In addition to who you are writing for, where you will publish and share  your data story matters. If you are presenting your work on national radio you would not use the same narratives or terminology as if you are pre­ senting your work at an industry conference. Likewise, if you are deliver­ ing a presentation to funders in a boardroom, your key messages should  look different than if you are pitching a policy change in a press release. When we take a step back from our own work, the fact that we need to  alter our storytelling by audience segmentation can seem obvious."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"A good data storyteller needs to know their audience and adjust ac­ cordingly. Understanding what each audience segment wants in terms of data complexity and narrative delivery can help you pitch your stories  more effectively and efficiently. It might be that you need to present the  same finding in five different ways. As long as you are clear on the key  messages, this kind of tailoring becomes easier to do over time."

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"When creating a data story you need to meet your audience half-way. As  the data storyteller your job is to provide a structure for your audience to   follow and embed the messages for what you want them to think, feel,  and do.

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"Whatever approach you choose,  narrative is key to telling better data stories. What’s Narrative    Got to Do with It? The most fundamental structure of a data story is its narrative. The nar­ rative is what you construct to deliver your message. It’s how you embed   what you want your audience to know, how you inspire them to feel, and  the way you incite them to act. A basic definition of narrative is “a spoken  or written account of connected events.” How these events unfold over  time forms the narrative structure of a story."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Today this model is called Freytag’s Pyr­ amid, illustrated by a graphic that lays out the five stages of this narrative arc in a peaked shape of rising and falling action:  027     Exposition – Setting up the scene of the story, background, and characters  Rising Action – The conflicts and events that build the story  Climax – The turning point or most intense moment in the story  Falling Action – The actions that happen as a result of the climax Denouement – End of action  A seven-step version of the pyramid includes two further turning points:  Inciting Incident – Something that happens to begin the action  Resolution – Conflicts in the narrative are tied together or solved  ↳Freytag's Pyramid  Narrative in Data Storytelling  While it might be obvious how this basic narrative structure works in fic­ tion, it can be harder to see how it might apply to a set of research find­ ings or policy recommendations. Addressing this, data storyteller Brent  Dykes adapted Freytag’s pyramid:  Exposition – Set-up/Background  Inciting Incident – Deviation from the expected  Rising Action – Supporting facts  Climax – Main insight  Resolution – Recommendation and next steps  028         Dykes argues that while it can be tempting to structure a data story  around your process of data analysis, by starting with your research  question or hypothesis, instead a data storyteller should be focused on  key insights. The exposition and inciting incident should backup the ‘cli­ max’ of the main insight, rather than explain how you got to your research  question or hypothesis—as would be common in more traditional styles of writing up findings. Here again you must think like a storyteller. Looking at an example can  help illustrate this difference and show how Freytag’s model can be used  to give narrative structure to data insights."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"In example 1, the character of the data story is the researcher and the nar­ rative arc of the story is about research methodology.

This is a classic Rags to Riches story."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"While most data stories will lack the drama of Cinderella, understanding  emotional story arcs can help strengthen your storytelling. If we take the earlier example of the ‘BU is friendly, data story, the emotional arc could  resemble this Cinderella structure.

Teaming up with our clients at Public Health Dorset, the  aim of the workshop was to create data stories that captured the health  benefits of battling unhealthy eating, alcoholism, and smoking. The Hero’s Journey arises from the work of Joseph Campbell. Like Booker,  Campbell looked across stories to identify common narrative structures. Working with mythology in particular, Campbell came up with 17 stages  that a hero goes through, organised into three acts: departure (from the  ordinary world), initiation (tasks and trials of the special world), and return  (transformation and growth upon returning to the ordinary world)."

Here we see  data presented around an object that serves as composite characters—a  universal pair of jeans that stands in for jeans in general. The life of this  garment type is revealed to us through the jeans’ point of view, as it jour­ neys from production to redistribution. Utilising techniques from sequen­ tial art, the reader learns about the political economy of this everyday  fashion item by scrolling through a series of hand-drawn infographics  panels."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"For  example, part of the final panel reads, “Many Kenyan clothing factories  have closed after being undercut by cheap imports” and, “In some Afri­ can countries used clothes are known as the clothes of the dead whites .”  A subtext of colonialism reinforces the background context and gives  emotion to the data story told here. When writing nonfiction, conflict needs to be understood loosely with  a focus on sparking curiosity, connecting with core values, or igniting  compassion from your audience. Consider the following data stories and  how they immediately set up a conflict to frame their data and draw the  audience in:  038   Worksheet: Conflict in Data Storytelling  Data Story Conflict in Data Story Conflict Type  Spies in the Sky  Peter Aldhous and Charles Seife  6 April 2016 — Buzzfeed  See maps Showing Where FBI Planes Are Watching  From Above   America is being watched from above.

The cars produce big  power and big data."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"Fate/Gods   In both of these quite diff er ent examples of data stories, the reader is  pulled in through the set up of tension. In the BuzzFeed interactive story  “Spies in the Sky,” text and maps are used together to show the operation  of FBI surveillance planes. By creating an opening scene of US civilians  being watched from above, the authors are able to quickly establish nar­ rative tension. The reader is interpellated into an already existing set of  ideas or ideologies around government surveillance."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Similar to The Jour­ ney of Jeans, this kind of narrative tension between familiar entities can  help the reader navigate a story and provide background context beyond  the content of the data story itself. Because of the pre-existing power im­ balance between the two (or more) sides, this approach is particularly  useful when creating data stories that involve civil rights, corporations,  governments, or other large institutions in contrast to smaller organisa­ tions or individuals.  039     The second example works with a very different sense of conflict. This  graphic draws on a sense of human wonder. The limits of innovation are  set in productive tension with what humans can currently create with  technology. Rather than mobilising conflict in a negative sense, this kind  of narrative tension is created through the collision of human-technolog­ ical advancement with the contemporary limits of invention."

Details, Details  While conflict propels a story along, it is detail that gives it lasting mem-  ory. Nonfiction author and former New York Times editor Francis Fla­ herty (2009) writes, “All stories are divided into two parts, the action and  the commentary” (p. 75). Flaherty uses the metaphor of a boat to show  the two duties of a writer: to keep the boat moving and, at the same time, to explain the passing scenery to passengers."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Marcy Kennedy (2016) offers this advice in her Description: A Busy  Writer's Guide :  In order to justify its existence, every passage of description should do  two or more of the following things:  →  Ground the reader in the setting  →  Symbolize or foreshadow something important to the story  →  Enhance the theme  →  Add subtext  →  Show something about the viewpoint character’s personality  →  Add conflict or complications  →  Hint at backstory  Translating this advice into a data storytelling context, we’ve created a  ‘Details Tick List Test’ that can be used for thinking about what detail to  include in a data story. While you don’t need to include all of these ele­ ments, like a two-drink minimum, it is useful to follow a two-ticks mini­mum principle:   Provide background information on context   Add further evidence to the main data insight   Add depth to the broader context   Show something unique about the data   Add conflict or complicate the data   Provide data backstory  An example can help illustrate how this ‘Details Tick List Test’ works. In  2014 the New York Times ran a graphic called ‘Mapping the Spread of  the Military’s Surplus Gear.’  This editorial graphic told the story of how  a US Defense Department program created in the early 1990s allowed  for state and local police departments to obtain surplus military-style  equipment. The graphic shows a map of the United States using orange  fill with white boundary lines to show counties that obtained surplus  equipment."

For those   who choose to explore further and go onto GitHub, there is another layer  of detail presented, as well as a link out to a larger project on military sur­ plus equipment transfers conducted by MuckRock, an organisation spe­ cialising in Freedom of Information Act requests, that obtained a list of every law enforcement agency that took part in the programme, allowing  them to breakdown data in more detailed wa ys than just by country (as  the New York Times project had done).

Equipped with narrative strategies and storytelling techniques,  datasets can be turned into powerful and persuasive evidence. Yet, to  become a data storyteller dedicated to transparency and accountability,  one must be equipped to ask difficult questions about where data comes  from, who can access it, and who can engage with the tools and skills  needed to analyse and visualise it. As both a practice and a growing cultural industry, data storytelling has  taken shape within the uneven terrain of digital media where power re­ mains concentrated amongst corporate firms, dominant in the West, and  unequally distributed along racial and gender lines. Together these im­ balances in power, resources, and access are leading to a data divide. The data divide is growing for a number of reasons. First, accessing,  analysing, and visualising data requires time and resources."

Sensitive subjects (such as information on refugees, prisoners, children, detainees, and those living in conflict zones) often  have no straightforward data source, or documents are scattered across  agencies and organisations. This makes some issues easier to gather  data on—and therefore to tell stories about—than others. In this sense  there is also a data divide between data that is easy to access, analyse,  and share (for example: weather patterns, traffic, sports statistics, baby names) versus data that is difficult to capture, yet very important for un­ derstanding the world (for example: climate change-based migration, deaths of refugees, rates of rape and sexual assault)."

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Applied to data storytelling, it asks us to think about how  our identities and experiences matter for how we go about gathering,  analysing, and storytelling with data. Standpoint theory has also been criticised on the grounds that it advo­ cates for an epistemological relativism. These critiques ask, how can we  make any claims to truth about the world if every knowledge-claim is rel­ative to the speaker’s social identity? But standpoint theorists (many of  whom were scientists or had training in the sciences) do not claim that  making evidence-based, testable observations is impossible; as Donna  Haraway (2004) argues, “the alternative to relativism is not totalization  and single vision” but “partial, locatable, critical knowledges sustaining  the possibility of webs of connections called solidarity in politics and  shared conversations in epistemology” (p. 89)."

Quantitative data collection and evalu­ ative thinking gave way to a range of graphical developments for repre­ senting statistical information. While government institutions were the  primary users of these new graphic techniques, this period also saw the  employment of information visualisation for social campaigns, including  John Snow’s cholera map and Florence Nightingale’s rose diagram on  preventable deaths in the Crimea War. Today, 19th century conventions for the graphical display of information  continue to be used by data visualisation designers (Kennedy et al., 2016)."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Too much use of the same template comes with the risk  of creating visual data stories that get further and further abstracted from  the question of ‘what is at stake?’  Too much plugging data into templates without reflection can also make  it difficult to answer the question ‘Why does this visualisation matter?’  When the process of designing a visualisation is detached from the  process of data collection, preparation, and analysis, it can be hard to  create a meaningful data story. Understanding the context, backstory, or  potential biases of the data you are working with is important for adding meaning. Without this understanding, you are left with only the surface  to work with. → You can learn more about John Snow’s   Cholera map in the section The Problem   with Maps as Representations and Florence   Nightingale’s rose diagram in Defining Big   Data.  → D3 is a JavaScript library for visualising   data using web standards.

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Along with many of the other data storytelling teams discussed in this  workbook, we integrate visualisation into the process of our data story­ telling. As visualisations are both representational artefacts and explor­ atory tools, they can lead to richer understandings of the data you are  working with. Thus, rather than treat visualisation as a separate design  step that comes after all the data analysis is complete, it can function as  part of a two-way communication system. Taking this approach, we find  that often the most important questions emerge during the process of  visualising for our data stories: What standpoints are being privileged? Who or what is missing? How can we better account for the biases and  backstory in our datasets? In order for data visualisation to be about more than making information  beautiful, it must be approached with the same reflective and critical  thinking as any other aspect of a data storytelling project. This is why we  believe that people should be equipped with the conceptual and prac­ tical tools needed to tell visual data stories that matter. These tools are  what help us grapple with the challenges of graphic design and visual  storytelling. They are what allow us to engage with the challenges of sen­ sitive subjects, missing data, messy data, data biases, and all the other  obstacles that working with data throws our way. Feminist Data Visualisation  → In visual culture, binaries refer to binary   oppositions or two categories that are set in   contrast to each other, such as man/woman,   love/hate, nature/culture, straight/gay."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Our approach to visual data storytelling is indebted to recent work in fem­ inist data visualisation. One of the main things that feminist data visualis­ ation is concerned with is how biases in perception and representation  can become embedded into design practice. These biases often get  repeated in data visualisations without reflection or questioning. As a re­ sult, negative stereotypes can be reproduced, marginalised voices can  get erased or obscured, and many issues can get left out of visual data  stories all together."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"A basic example of how this happens in visual data storytelling comes  with the represention of gender—one of the most common binary di­ vides found in data. In infographics and other data visualisations, gender  representations are often limited to the traditional bathroom sign iconog­raphy for man and woman. A long haired figure in a dress is contrasted  to a short haired figure with straight legs. Imagine that you are creating  a visual data story. If these are the only options available in a design tem­plate or icon set, yet you want to represent gender differently, what would  you do? How could you go for a gender-neutral approach? A similar gen­ dered bias occurs in visual symbols when, for example, all sports icons depict male figures doing activities or when icons for particular profes­ sions are gendered exclusively male or female.  117   Behind the scenes, problems of bias and representation also occur, lim­ iting the kinds of data stories we can tell. For example, if the data being  visualised does not include any demographic information about gender,  then gender cannot be visualised at all. For example, a dataset our BU  Civic Media Hub team worked with from CATO’s National Police Miscon­ duct Reporting Project, did not have gender attached to its data points. All acts of police misconduct in the dataset were recorded by general  type (i.e. assault, drunk driving, perjury)."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"This pointed to the need to tell an additional data story about the gendered nature of recorded police vio­ lence against women. To visually tell that story with statistical graphics,  first we needed to notice that the information was missing. While these examples discussed so far are about gender, the same prin­ ciples hold true for how we visually represent race, age, disability, sexual­ ity, class, and other categories that are important for addressing diversity, inequalities, and injustices. Thinking beyond the human, this is also the  case for how we represent buildings, cars, dogs and trees—to name only  a few representable nonhumans."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"They argue that, while centred on design, a feminist approach to data  visualisation “insists that data, design, and community of use, are inex­ tricably intertwined.” In line with our approach at BU Civic Media Hub, this means that we cannot separate the question of where data comes  from and what audiences our data stories are for, from the processes of  creating them.

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Neon coloured radial diagrams  can be daunting for data storytelling beginners. The thought of learning  to code, understanding statistics, and wrapping your head around five  kinds of tree diagrams (none of which look like trees) is overwhelming. When data visualisation is presented to us as being about making com­ plexity beautiful, rather than telling a story that matters, the task of data  visualisation can feel out of reach. Starting from what the end product  looks like can lead people to believe that they are not good enough art­ ists, statisticians, or computer scientists to ever become visual data sto­ rytellers (Feigenbaum et al., 2016)."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"In other  words, it was the process of visually organising this information that re­ vealed the data stories that mattered.

We begin with a quick introduction to structuring your data, written for  those of you who collect qualitative data, but may not have much expe­ rience with spreadsheets. We then introduce semiotics, a foundational  set of concepts for understanding visual communication."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Following these introductions, we explore the finer details of putting to­ gether a visual data story by breaking down the visual representation of data into four componant parts or what we have called ‘The Four Pillars’:  Symbol, Colour, Caption, and Editorial. We then delve deeper into the  world of data visualisation, using Andy Kirk’s CHRTS guide for selecting what graph best suits different kinds of data, based on the messages or  meanings you want to communicate to your target audience. A Quick Guide to   Structuring Your Data  For those of you already working with spreadsheets or relational data­ bases, structured data is something you will be familiar with. However,  for those new to this terminology, understanding how data is structured  (or unstructured) will lead to better data thinking and with it, better data  visualisations."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"Becoming familiar with structured data can help you more  efficiently and effectively record, store, and manipulate your data, making  it much easier to tell visual data stories. This kind of basic data literacy  will also help you get a better sense of what chart types to pick, how to  troubleshoot when things go wrong, and how to know when anomalies  are likely to be data input errors, rather than riveting data stories.  122   In our trainings with humanities researchers, journalists, and NGOs, we  often find that people have vast, rich piles of data that could be visualised  in charts or graphs, but they are stored in a format that makes it incredibly  difficult to begin the task of data visualisation. For example, contacts and  their affiliations may be typed up in one long list. Information on differ­ ent people or organisations might be laid out in a table, but that table  is in a Word document. Or someone might be using a spreadsheet, but  each cell contains a bunch of random information that varies across the  rows."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"In these cases, under­ standing what goes on behind the interface of the data tools you are using  is important for increasing your data literacy and with it, the capacity to tell  better data stories. Research software programmes like SPSS and Nvivo,  as well as automated dashboards used by statistical offices, companies, and universities, often mask the actual processes involved in creating  structured data. They limit what we can see and manipulate. In doing so,  they are already shaping the kinds of stories we can tell."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Learn­ ing how to work with spreadsheets is an important foundational skill for  anyone wanting to become a data storyteller. One of the biggest challenges when creating or modifying datasets is  the tedious task of cleaning data. But the harsh reality is, the more struc­ture you give to your data early on, the easier it makes your life, and the  lives of others later. This means creating well thought-out spreadsheets  in advance of moving or modifying your data, using data validation func­ tions to ensure consistency (especially if you have more than one person  inputting information), and becoming familiar with cleaning software like  Openrefine, particularly for larger datasets."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Semiotics for Data Storytelling   While spreadsheets can feel like a familiar dialect to some, to others  they are a daunting foreign language to learn. Likewise, those with back­ grounds in communication studies may spot the meaning of a message  instantly that would remain undetectable to someone else without any  training in the field. Just as structured data is essential to those working  with data, semiotics, or the study of signs, can help data storytellers bet­ ter account for how people respond to visual representations (Hullman  and Diakopoulos, 2011). Perhaps the most well-known theory of semiotics comes from Roland Barthes. Drawing on the work of linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, Barthes  (1972) argued that there are two basic levels of meaning. Denotation re­ fers to the most basic description of an image."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"This is  important when visually representing sensitive subjects or creating icons  that will travel across languages and cultures.  125                            When applied to planning for visualisation, semiotics can help a data story­ teller put questions about perspective at the centre of their process. Deci­ sions about visual representation can be made according to the distinction  between formal qualities (i.e. shape, colour, position), and how these come  to take on meaning. Likewise, semiotics can help us better anticipate what  to encode into visualisation, by helping us reflect on the different layers of  meaning that the decoder or individual viewer may see. In this way, semiot­ ics helps us understand the importance of perspective, of audience, and of  different standpoints."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Four Pillars for   Data Storytelling  → Another terminology used in cultural   studies to think about how communication   works is Stuart Hall’s notion of encoding   and decoding. Encoding is the production of   meaning in a cultural artefact and decoding   is how a viewer understands or interprets   the meaning of a cultural artefact. Contexts,   standpoints and perspectives can make the   encoded and decoded meanings different,   and can explain differences in how individu­als or communities decode meaning. These   terms became popular in subcultural studies   to explore things like punk."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"Reflecting in advance about the range of meanings an image can have,  and about how different perspectives might lead to different interpreta­ tions of an image, is crucial for generating effective visual data stories for  your audience. At the same time, there are also some universal design  principles that can serve as a foundation for creating visual data stories. These principles hold whether you are making a network graph using big  data, or an infographic that mixes personal testimonies with small-scale  numeric data. To help make sense of the hundreds of universal design principles out there, we’ve organised those that we have found most use­ ful in our visual data storytelling trainings into Four Pillars: Symbol, Colour,  Caption, and Editorial. Symbol  Just like data is defined differently across different fields, so too is the  meaning of the word ‘symbol.’ In semiotics a symbol is differentiated from an icon and an index, which are all categorised under the heading of ‘signs’. Web designer and author Stephen Bradley (2016) explains the differences:  →	 An Icon has a physical resemblance to the signified, the thing being  represented. A photograph is a good example as it certainly resem­ bles whatever it depicts.  →	 An Index shows evidence of what’s being represented."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"By thinking transdiciplinar­ily about symbols, two key principles emerge that can guide your use of  symbols in data storytelling.  1. Symbols should be resonant – When something is resonant it re­ lates on an embodied level. One responds to it instantly. Whether  simple like the symbols on a road sign, or more complex like the symbols for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, as a data storyteller you want   your audience to quickly get what it is you are trying to represent. Ide­ ally, not only would they comprehend your symbol, they would also  connect with it, opening up space for meanings to become stickier.   2. Symbols should be relevant  – For symbols to resonate they need   to be relevant. This means that the symbols you create or choose to   use should be the right match for your audience."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"For example, if you have nominal data and you want to make one cate­ gory standout as the subject of your data story, you may choose to cre­ ate a contrast in its saturation or value. This is particularly useful when  the point you are trying to make is not that this category is the largest or  smallest, but where it falls in relation to the others. For example, if your  data story is about the experiences of Nigerian students in the United  Kingdom, you may choose to highlight the data for Nigerians across a  range of graphs that compare different international students experienc­ es. This would help guide the reader along your data story. At the same  time, you may not want to use a different colour entirely, as this may be too much contrast and feel like you are stealing the spotlight, overshad­ owing the supporting characters in your data story. You may also want to use contrast to highlight variables in your data if you  are trying to point out a pattern that is not necessarily going to stand out  on its own. For example, when creating visualisations from our additional coding of data from CATO National Police Misconduct Reporting Project,  we wanted to highlight the pattern we found around gendered violence  and violence against women. This led us to make the decision to use a bold colour only for those categories that related to women and gen­ dered violence."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"Working with online tools, as well as old fashioned colour  wheels, can help you make informed decisions on what colours to use  and when.  131       Colour metaphors and gradients – The other main way that colour is  primarily used to tell visual data stories is with colour metaphors and gra­ dients. Here colour is used to represent scales or increases and decreas­ es in values. Colour metaphors refer to the use of different colours that carry particular meanings or connotations in a shared cultural context  (i.e. green for go, red for stop). A colour gradient refers to a range of col- our transitions that is often gradual and blends together as it progresses  (i.e. from blue for cold to red for hot)."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"When you have ordinal data, a colour metaphor may be useful for telling  your data story. For example, the Monash University guide to FODMAP   diet-friendly foods uses a green, yellow, red scheme to make distinctions  between for foods that are good to eat, foods that can be eaten in small  quantities, and foods that should be avoided. This kind of scheme is common in health graphics, as discussed below. For interval data, col-our gradients are a common choice to represent change, rankings, or  intensity."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"As the same visual image  can mean different things to different people, we need to guide viewers  to the intended message of our data story—our Think, Feel, and Do. This  means that we need to limit the possible meanings a visual image can  have. For example, ever year people in the United States spend millions  of dollars on red roses for Valentine’s Day. Imagine you have a dataset  about the export of red roses to the United States."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"By  crafting carefully worded text that anchors the images in your data story,  you can stop viewers’ interpretations drifting away from your intended  messages. When creating your captions think about the other possible interpreta­ tions of your visual images—including charts, graphs and other illustrat­ ed elements of your data story. Then brainstorm how best to use captions  to steer the viewer along the narrative of your data story. Captions can  also be used to highlight details and spotlight elements essential to your  data story.  135                   Editorial  The fourth and final pillar of data storytelling is editorial layout . Editorial  layout refers to how the different visual elements of your data story are  strategically arranged onto a page, screen, poster or whatever platform  you are using in order to effectively and efficiently reach your target audi­ ence. The layout you choose should work well to get across your intend­ed message—the Think, Feel, Do of your data story. In today’s cross-platform, digital/analogue hybrid world, you will often be  designing a data story for multiple platforms, making it even more impor­ tant to consider editorial layout from the start of your data storytelling pro­ cess. How many elements you choose to include, your colour scheme,  the size and detail of your symbols, and other illustrated elements all  depend on the amount of space you have to work with. Often a fantastic data story is designed for a webpage, but ends up far too detailed to work on a smartphone screen. If most of your audience is reading off their  smartphones, you will need to think about this when making decisions  about the design details of your visual data story. This is why we advise our students and clients that layout should come  at the start of the planning process. Before you even begin to select sym­ bols, fonts or chart types, ask: What different screen sizes does this layout  need to work for? This question is as important for print-based data sto­ries as for digital ones."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"This is where the page or screen is divided into smaller parts that fit to­ gether in a grid system, and can be a good starting place for designing  your visual data stories. Based on best practices in design around using  grid layouts, we created the ‘6 card design’ challenge. Working with re­ stricted layout templates can help guide your design process. For our ‘6  card design’ challenge we give each group of participants a set of index cards or cut rectangles of paper and a sheet of paper, along with the  brief that they must design a 6 element visual data story that can work on  a smart phone screen (either by swiping through the story or as stand­alone mini-narratives), and be fitted together to form a printable poster. This challenge helps guide people’s creative process from the start, high­ lighting the importance of layout to the decisions we make about charts,  graphs, symbols, captions and other editorial story components. Mini Exercise: Modular Design Challenge  Using 6 equally sized cards, try to create a modular layout for a visual  data story that would work both on a mobile phone and as a printed  poster. Before you begin, make sure you have selected at least one  target audience and done the Think, Feel, Do exercise for them. In  your editorial layout, try to include:  → A headline and introductory text  → Four charts or graphs with captions on individual cards  → A ‘take action’ card designed particularly to try and turn your ‘think  and feel’ into a ‘do’  Another task we do with clients and students uses a 6-panel tem­ plate laid out sequentially, following the way comic narratives are read. You can find details on this challenge in the Learning from  Comics and activities sections.  →  See the sections on Types of Narrative and   What is Conflict in Data Storytelling. While these design principles are a good starting place for improving and  reflecting on the process of laying out a data story, it is also important  to embrace the experimental and break out of these proscriptive struc­tures. A spin on this same activity asks participants to take their modular  6 card design and then redesign it, throwing out all the rules of grids and  order to see what else they can create. We sometimes do a modified ver­ sion of this creative activity by supplying participants with printouts from  a template-based visualisation software programme, like Tableau, and  then having them use scissors and glue sticks to reconstruct the existing  data story. This task can be paired with thinking about types of conflict or the seven basic plots in order to practice figuring out how storytelling  structures and visual layouts fit together. It is this process of strategically  arranging your visual elements to tell your data story that creates a pow­ erful editorial.  137           Seven  Genres of  Narrative  Visualisation   ↳Magazine style ↳Annotated chart ↳Partitioned poster  Flow chart ↳Comic strip ↳Slide show   ↳Film/Video/Animation   ↳  In their study of 58 data visualisations taken from online journalism, busi­ ness and data visualisation research, Segel and Heer (2010) found that  there were seven commonly employed genres of narrative visualisation. Informed by the work of comic Scott McCloud, they described these   different uses of space as: magazine style, annotated chart, partitioned  poster, flow chart, comic strip, slide show, and film/video/animation (p.  7). Importantly, these genres can be mixed, and while it may be more tra­ ditional to see an annotated chart in a boardroom and a comic strip in a  classroom, there are no rules on what genre is necessarily best for your  audience. What matters is how each of these different styles of layout  supports some narrative structures, while limiting others. →  Scott McCloud’s books Understanding   Comics (1993), Reinventing Comics (2000)   and Making Comics (2006) have now   become canonical reading for data visualis­ ation designers."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"For example, a magazine layout may be more useful for a data story that  requires lengthy text to contextualise accompanying data visualisations, whereas a slide show may work better for a series of graphics, presented   as visual evidence, leading the viewer to a final argument or action point. Importantly, Segel and Heer (2010) also found across their research sam­ ple an “under-utilization of common narrative messaging techniques such as repetition of key points, introductory texts, and final summaries  and syntheses” (p. 7).    ↳ Seven Genres of Narrative Visualisation. Adapted from Narrative Visualization: Telling   Stories with Data, by E. Segel & J. Heer, 2010. Illustrations by Alexandra Alberda.  138    A Summary of the Four Pillars for Visual Data Storytelling  139    Whatever genre and layout style you choose, a final important part of  creating effective and efficient designs is to avoid unnecessary features. While some illustrative icons or added details may enhance a data story,  making good editorial decisions requires learning how to differentiate be­ tween functional flourishes and ornamental embellishments. These un­ necessary add-ons are what Edward Tufte infamously labelled chartjunk .  140   Chartjunk   ‘Chartjunk’ is by now a well-used and hotly debated phrase in data visual­ isation circles. Coined by Edward Tufte in his canonical 1983 book, The  Visual Display of Quantitative Information , chartjunk refers to what Tufte  calls “the interior decoration of graphics [that] does not tell the viewer  anything new” (p. 107). Causing decades of controversy, he argued that  such embellishments, found across technical papers, commercial ads,  and media graphics, might at first appear to add value to a visualisation,  but in reality were a distraction."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Not only do these practices obscure the significance of data,  they can also hinder data literacy and alienate beginners from seeing themselves as data storytellers, as we discussed earlier in this chapter. Edward Tufte’s notion of chartjunk continues to be the subject of visualis­ ation trainings, keynote conference talks, and heated Twitter discussions. Offering a different perspective, data visualiser, consultant, and educator  Stephen Few argues that Tufte’s view may be too dismissive. In a news­ letter about a 2010 study on chartjunk , Few (2011) wrote, “Embellishments  can at times, when properly chosen and designed, represent information  redundantly in useful ways, and even when they aren’t information in and  of themselves, can meaningfully support the display of information.” In  particular, Few notes the potential effectiveness of properly (or profes­ sionally) designed embellishments that work memorably or metaphori­ cally, immersing readers in the data presented."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"Depending on what data stories you want to tell, different as­ pects of these datasets can be visualised using a wide variety of graphs.

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"These features  make treemaps powerful narrative tools for the data storyteller. Narrative Networks  Another type of visualisation that is very useful for data storytelling is the  network graph. Recently, Liliana Bounegru and her colleagues (2017)  wrote that “the narrative or storytelling potential of networks is just begin­ ning to receive more sustained attention from researchers” (p. 700). Net­ work graphs are used to illuminate associations or relationships between  data points. In a network graph, relationships are displayed as nodes (or  vertices) connected by links (or edges)."

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"This is what we refer to as ‘caption’ and ‘ed­ itorial’—two of the ‘Four Pillars’ essential for telling visual data stories. These pieces of written information help frame the data story and cue  the reader toward what to look for and pay attention to. Depending on the  complexity of the visualisation, accompanying text can also help make  network graphs more accessible to less statistically minded readers. When network graphs are used to analyse very large data sets, they are  often presented in an interactive format that allows the user to manipulate  the graphical display, zoom in on individual nodes, or otherwise ‘move’ through the visualisation. Data visualisers can also introduce a temporal  dimension to a network graph in order to show how associations change over time."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Tinkering with Timelines  Another particularly important graphical form for data storytellers is the  timeline. Timelines have existed for thousands of years. In fact, they are  one of the oldest forms of information visualisation. Used in ancient soci­eties to record important people, events, and inventions, timelines were  key tools for keeping track of culture, histories, and heritage."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Very few data points can make the cut and claim a spot in a timeline’s  data story. What gets left off the timeline becomes visually absent from  the history being presented. In this sense timelines are ruthless. They force data storytellers to make  difficult decisions about what data points should be emphasised and  why. Having a clear approach to how you are making your selections can  help negotiate biases and standpoints. For example, when we created  our timelines for tear gas and impact munitions infographics as part of  the RiotID project, we wanted to highlight the international nature of these weapons’ development, expansion, and use. This meant that in ad­ dition to including key moments of technical invention, we also included  major international conflicts where the weapons had been deployed in particularly harmful or unlawful ways."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"For this reason, timelines often work well as an accompaniment  to other forms of data storytelling. In our RiotID examples, the timeline  forms just one part of the story, providing a historical background for  the more public health and humanitarian information that is the focus  of these infographics. It serves as an anchor, rather than an overarching  explanation or history. Applying the Four Pillars of Visual Data Storytelling  to timelines, caption, and editorial layout are key. Putting timelines to creative use, some people have experimented with  this form to add storytelling layers to more traditional timelines. For exam­ ple, in Kate Evan’s graphic biography Red Rosa  (2015), a timeline is used  to tell the story of how Rosa Luxemburg researched the 1905 Moscow  Uprising of the Russian Revolution. The events are presented as patches  on a patchwork quilt."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"At present, the data storytelling potential of life course narratives is un­ derutilised. The visual presentation of life courses is often disconnected  from the underlying data, leading to a separation of evidence-based in­formation and personal narratives. From a data storytelling perspective,  bringing together broader, quantitative or statistical data with personal  stories can maximise the impacts of evidence and interventions by dis­ playing data points chronologically, situated in the larger context of what  was going on in someone’s life. By relating health patterns to people’s  lived realities, and empowering people through reflecting on their own lives, this data storytelling approach could then enhance buy-in from a  range of stakeholders and the public. Astrid Shubring et al. (2019) argue,  “The biographical mapping approach possesses great potential for quali­ tative research, the visualization of research results, as well as for practi­ cal application” (p. 10). ↳ This life course drawing is a ‘biographical   mapping’ created by a youth athlete in a   research project on adolescents’ health   and illness experiences in elite sport (see    Schubring et al., 2019). When creating the   mappings, the participating athletes were   asked to draw multi-thematic development   lines representing their performance (red),   health (black), the relevance of health   (green) and nutrition (blue) over time. Confi­ dential information has been blinded.  158       Visualising Absence   If you work with data over a long enough period, it’s inevitable that you  will come across data sets that contain missing values."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"The task of the data storyteller is not to throw up  her hands and say ‘Oh well’ to missing data, but to find ways to include it  in the narratives she tells. In his popular webinar “How to Visualise Null and Zero,” Andy Kirk ex­ plores best practices around visualising ‘nothing.’ He makes the power­ ful insight that gaps in data are often just as revealing as the data that’s  available. Kirk outlines three different ways that ‘nothing’ can appear in  data. First, data sets often contain zero values."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"If she wants to  tell a data story about why some days generate more value than others,  paying attention to these zero values is key. Ignoring these gaps in her  data set would mean missing out on an opportunity to better understand  her business and would lead to an incomplete data story. The second instance of ‘nothing’ that Kirk describes is cases where parts  of the data simply aren’t available. In these instances, the data isn’t zero—  it’s non-existent, or ‘null.’ Data sets about sensitive subjects are rife with  null data. In a blog post for Behind the Numbers , part of the Canadian  Centre for Policy Alternatives, researcher Katherine Scott makes the im­ portant point that measures of gender inequality, such as wage gap data,  don’t tell the whole story of women’s lives if data about, say, Indigenous  women’s experiences are missing."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"As data visualisation researcher Benjamin  Bach and his colleagues argue in a recent paper (written as a comic),  “Although comics are familiar to everyone, they are vastly underexplored  for data-driven storytelling” (Bach et al., 2017). While research repeatedly  shows that familiarity with comics can help comprehension, it should be  noted that not all readers will have the same literacy level when it comes  to reading comics. Some will be more familiar than others with more ex­ perimental features in comics. At the BU Civic Media Hub, we summarised the reasons for why comics  work well for data storytelling around three principles. Comics are: ap­ proachable, accessible, and relatable. These three principles are useful  in thinking about how graphics reach out to audiences, especially when  trying to connect people with complex or sensitive data, such as health  data. The use of graphics to represent decision-making in health has  repeatedly been proven useful in patient communication (Chuang et al.,  2010; Green and Meyers, 2010; Hawley et al., 2008)."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"This sequential aspect of comics also contributes to its potential for enhancing data-driven storytelling. Bach et al. (2017) suggest  that making use of panels can help break complex processes into less  complex units, helping guide the reader through transitions. For example,  panels might be used in a data-driven comic story to move from detail  to broader context, or as a way of drilling-down from broader picture to  smaller detail. Comics are likewise accessible in that they are usually presented in an  easy to understand format."

Sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound shape how  we perceive and engage our environments. Put another way, we inhabit  the world through our bodies, and how we inhabit the world continually  changes it. Responding to this reality, artists and researchers have start­ed to incorporate sound, taste, touch, and smell into their representations of numerical data."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"The  significance of multisensory mapping for data storytelling is manifold. It  means that a larger range of people’s experiences and voices can come  to bear on research practices and knowledge production. In 2010, artist/researchers AM Kanngieser and Manuela Zechner under­ took a project in Shanghai, China, speaking with young people about their  experiences of precarious labour in the cultural industries as part of the  Transit Labour project. Alongside interviews and participant observation,  the project organised a mapping session in which participants were in­ vited to map out the ways in which their work affected their everyday lives."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"A simple way to introduce multisensory experience into your data story  is by incorporating interactivity: inviting the user to play or manipulate  with the data in real time. This is beneficial because it allows the user to  compare different trends in data, explore how variables interact, or simply  allow for free and open exploration.

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Taking each datum as a fundamental component of digital data storytell­ing, they created their own visual representations of radiation contamination in a map form as a rhetorical resource for making an argument. Just as Rosenberg (2013) suggests, data are essen­ tially rhetorical resources for making a claim. In other words, we collect data for making persuasive claims. From suggestions on how to avoid specific spots where the level of radiation is higher than neigh­bouring areas (“hotspots”) to requests for the decon­tamination practices from local government, people measure radiation and make maps to persuade oth­ers into taking action."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"Following in the footstep of Toulmin’s (2003) model on argument, argumentative mapmaking as a distinctive form of data storytelling can be seen as the process of making data, warrants, and claims that would persuade people into taking action. Distinct from more general data storytelling, argumentative mapmaking involves an explicit articulation of data collection and representation method as a warrant of an argument, making a clear connection between data and claim in the process of making maps. For example, take the case of the Minna no Data Site  (MDS) or the Combined Database of Independent Radioactivity Measurement Labs. MDS is a grass-roots database of citizen-generated data—it records measurement readings of citizens, by citizens and for citizens. Born in 2013, MDS embodies a key theme of argumentative mapping practice as data storytelling in compelling ways: it maps the past and imagines the future to make an argument about the present. From October 2014 to September 2017, more than four thou­sand MDS volunteers measured soil contamination in seventeen prefectures in East Japan, mapping the collected inputs as a rhetorical resource for making an argument. What is noteworthy is that MDS makes its data collection method available online for a wider audience. Sharing the details of data collection meth­ods is a key storytelling component of argumentative mapping practice for validating the accuracy of each datum, at least rhetorically (Abe 2016)."

By spatially visualising data, maps represent not just data points,  but also a particular geographical imagination of the world. In the past  decade geospatial technologies have transformed from solely a tool for  experts to software packages that can be freely available and offered as open source products. In recent years maps have flourished across the  web."

B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"How can the concept of argumentative map-making in Abe’s  spotlight help us understand the data story Snow was trying to tell?  3. Can you think of a time when you and another person both looked  at a map and interpreted it in different ways? What were your differ­ ent perspectives and are there any past experiences or prejudices  that might have informed them?  207                  While it is possible to take a great deal of care over the production of a map  to ensure different voices and perspectives are represented, two things  remain important to reflect upon about maps. First, as with all representa­ tions, some meanings will be encoded  into the map and others won’t make  it."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"In  other words, they are the basic building blocks for data storytelling with  maps. In 2017, Robert Roth built on Bertin’s original list, adapting the work  of MacEachren et al., 2012, to offer a visual taxonomy of 12 visual variables.  1. Location – position of a map symbol in relation to its coordinate sys­ tem (pin drop on)  2. Size – manipulate proportions and show value-by-area  3."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"One might be  easier for audiences to recognise right away, while the other makes more  visual sense for the narrative or data story you want to tell. Now let’s say in addition to mapping winter temperatures, you are looking  at the cost of heating compared to the average income in those areas. How do you represent the profit of energy companies? Or the number  of people at risk of freezing?"
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"While it was tempting to point and click and  plot pretty coloured pins, rather than stare at never-ending numeric rows,  working from a basic spreadsheet (or database) ultimately gave us much  more control over the data and allowed us to tell better data stories. While  we continued to use a Google alert to gather tear gas incidents, now they were thinking like  mapmakers. We recorded more precise locations, tak­ en from the news articles and recorded by city/town and country. Once the whole year of alerts was mapped into the spreadsheet, we were  able to turn the location names from text into coordinates for mapping in a matter of minutes."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data stories,"By adding this extra step of coding to the spatial or place-based data we  were able to tell more data stories, going beyond ‘who are the top tear  gas users’ to look at everything from the tear gassing of young people,  to the safety protocols that surround the misuse of tear gas in confined  spaces. By adding these simple details, the data became particularly  useful for human rights and governmental organisations like Amnesty  International and the Council of Europe.  217  For more visit:  →	  2015 Tear Gas Maps  http:/ /www.civicmedia.io/projects/tear-gas-maps-2015/  →	  Report on Misuse of Tear Gas for Council of Europe  http:/ /www.civicmedia.io/bu-civic-media-hub-the-omega-research­ foundation-publish-report-on-the-misuse-of-tear-gas-in-europe/  While the interactive mapping projects that we encounter online often  seem shiny and sophisticated, when many people begin to make maps  they have no clue what they are doing. As we have suggested throughout  this workbook, it is completely OK to not know what you are doing when  you begin. Data storytelling is a new field and like any new visual form  that is in its infancy, it is full of good and bad experiments. As the old ad­ age from Samuel Beckett goes, “Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.”  Mapping without Maps  “Is there any motif so malleable, so ripe for appropriation, as maps?” So  asks Katharine Harmon in her introduction to The Map As Art: Contempo­ rary Artists Explore Cartography  (Harmon & Clemans, 2009, p. 10)."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"In the past five years we have seen  some of our favourite platforms for training people in data storytelling  go defunct. Others got turned from free tools into prohibitively expensive  pay-for packages. And others pivoted in a new direction, moving away   from the collaborative ethos that was part of its foundation. As teachers  and facilitators we have to adapt, modifying our lessons to fit new—and  often less optimal—tools for data storytelling. But whatever products we  use as part of technological chains for creating data stories, the founda­ tional concepts found in this book serve as a guide. Their lessons are not  bound to the latest digital trend, design aesthetic, or venture capitalist  imitative. They are, for the most part, future-proof. In our ever-changing  working and technological environments, we believe that the foundations  for becoming a data storyteller should be able to move with the times. Resources, workflows, departmental structures, job descriptions and— of course—data continually change. With these changes we are forced  to not only renew and re-evaluate the way we work, but also to maintain  our working relationships with others. As so many data storytelling pro­ jects require expertise and input from others, collaboration is at the heart  of much of what we do. In this last section of our workbook we offer a  final set of concepts. We call them our “Four Cs for Collaboration.” These final principles reflect our ethos for collaboration: Curiosity, Clarity, Coor­ dination, and Care. Principle 1: Curiosity  Fundamental to all of our collaborative projects is a shared sense of the  project’s goal."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,storytelling with data,"It is this collaborative approach to storytelling with data that allows us to share in  the process and not just the final product. Principle 2: Clarity  While you often may not know what data stories you want to tell at the  beginning of a project , it is important to be clear about your expecta­ tions throughout the process of any project. This means having clearly  defined roles, a solid overview of available resources, and establishing  open channels of communication between collaborators. With these  things in place, when ideas, resources, or available funding changes, it is  much easier to make updates to tasks and timeframes. In particular, clarity—and transparency—is important around budgets  and pay rates."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"As data storytelling collaborations often involve working with  people that use completely different terminologies and backgrounds, the more we can translate our expectations and visions to each other clearly,  the easier it will be to navigate the process of a project. We often make  jargon-busting a key conversation in early planning meetings to make  sure that everyone is on the same page. Principle 3: Coordination  Once project goals and expectations are laid out, coordination becomes  a key concern. It is useful to establish what software and communication platforms you will use to carry out your project, particularly if face-to-face meetings will be limited or not an option at all."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data storytelling,"We often use collaborative  tools for our data storytelling projects that allow for live editing, such as  Google Sheets and Google Docs. Slack channels, Whatsapp groups and  Skype (or other video conferencing providers), work well in place of face­ to-face meetings as they allow for easily and quickly sharing links, photos,  and other work-in-progress materials. Make sure you select software and  communication systems that can accommodate everyone in your collab­oration and that everyone on board knows how to use these tools. It is also a good idea to set up shared repository or archive of your data  storytelling work in advance."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Like all  the other aspects of becoming a data storyteller, care is a capacity that  grows with reflection and practice. → Vicarious trauma refers to the indirect   exposure to trauma. In data storytelling this   often comes from working with testimony,   images and other mediated forms that   document trauma. Sam Dubberley & Michele Grant’s (2017)   Journalism and Vicarious Trauma: A Guide   for Journalists, Editor and News Organ­ isations  offers an excellent introductory   resource for anyone working with traumatic   materials. It is available to freely download   online at www.firstdraftnews.org/wp-con­ tent/uploads/2017/04/vicarioustrauma.pdf.  242         Act like the Data Storyteller   You Want to Be  Working to tell data stories together is a daunting task. In addition to all  of the technical and collaborative aspects of data storytelling, writing  nonfiction requires a diligent commitment to gathering evidence and  documenting information. This is serious stuff. But at the same time as  we work to maintain rigorous data practices, it is also important that we  foster playful, experimental spaces to stretch and grow our storytelling  muscles. However, in most data and evidence-based environments like  universities, think tanks, research centres, and statistics offices, there is  little room to make an inventive mess."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"To become a data story­ teller, you must learn to carve out spaces, find collaborators, and make  connections that allow our less disciplined selves and voices to speak. Once we tune into our creative energy, we realise these spaces for ex­ perimentation with storytelling exist all around us. And while we might not immediately get credit in the form of promotions or by-lines, there will always be people who notice, though they may be ‘friends in low places.’  But as anyone who has delved into the outskirts of their industry can tell  you, it is often our friends in low places that are the most crucial part of  our networks. They are the ones who support your outlandish ideas, who  bring you with them as their careers progress, who offer guidance when  it feels like no one else can see what you’re on about."
B3,The data storytelling workbook,1,0,data story,"Harnessed well, this self-showcas­ ing of your budding data storyteller persona can establish consistency  between your projects and help you build bridges between the research,  community, and industry spaces you want to reach.  243           As you establish networks and showcase work on your own terms, you  also begin to create your own archives. You can find new ways to gen­ erate collaborative databases that ‘count’ professionally, as well as to  find communities who ‘count’ these projects based on their own value  systems. This is how many data storytellers got started—as well as how  graphic medicine, graphic social science and related visual communica­ tion fields emerged. Groups of people found each other in their desire to  bridge the worlds of evidence and experience. They made knowledge  matter through their art and their empathy. They insisted that stories and  ‘facts’ could be beautiful across the full palette of human emotions."

If you want to better understand why data storytelling is so ef fective, again—this is the book. If you’re seeking to drive positive change with data, this book will equip you with everything you’ll need (at least, from a communication perspective). As you go through each chapter in this book, you’ll notice I start each one with a story— because that’ s how much I believe in the power of storytelling. Let us begin this adventure together , once upon an insight… * * * * After more than two years of intense research and writing, I’m excited to share my perspective on data storytelling. My journey toward writing this book began in 2013 when I convinced Adobe’ s event team to let me deliver a breakout session on “data storytelling” at our upcoming customer conference. At the time, it was an emer ging topic that resonated with me. Having worked with data for the better part of my career—over 15 years in enterprise analytics—I experienced daily how critical ef fective data communication was. This session was my first formal opportunity to share some of the early concepts and frameworks I had developed."

With the growth in data usage across small and lar ge or ganizations, people must increasingly be bilingual in data.

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"When you craft your data insight into a data story , you have a powerful vehicle for conveying meaning, engaging your audience, and driving change (see Figure 1.4 ). Figur e 1.4 When you present your insights as data stories, you’re more likely to influence decisions and drive actions that lead to value creation. The goal of this book is to help you marry the science of data  with the art of storytelling . I will attempt to impart a sound understanding of why data storytelling skills are essential to anyone who wishes to share insights with other people in a more ef fective manner . You will learn the core characteristics of a data story , and you’ll be introduced to the three core pillars of data storytelling: data, narrative , and visuals . To prepare you for your journey toward becoming a more ef fective data storyteller and change agent, here’ s an overview of the chapters in this book: Chapter 2 : Why T ell Stories with Data? You may not realize the influential and integral role stories play in your life. This chapter will explore the hidden power of stories and introduce a framework for harnessing the power of data storytelling. It will also examine the four key communication goals you should strive for when sharing data. This chapter will explore dif ferent empirical studies that reveal the unique advantages that narrative and visuals of fer in terms of persuasion and memorability . Chapter 3 : The Psychology of Data Storytelling You may expect facts to play a significant role in decision making. However , psychology and neuroscience research reveals emotion plays a more powerful role than logic and reason in decision making. In this chapter , you’ll learn more about how the human mind processes both statistics and stories. It will explore the various ways in which stories maintain an unexpected advantage over facts."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Chapter 4 : Anatomy of a Data Story Data storytelling has been associated with many dif ferent things—everything from data visualizations to data presentations to even marketing campaigns. In this chapter , you’ll receive a clearer understanding of what a data story is and the six essential elements that comprise a data story . It will also examine your critical role as the data storyteller and the importance of understanding your audience. Chapter 5 : Data: The Foundation of Y our Data Story Data forms the basic building blocks of your data stories. While this chapter doesn’ t focus on how to perform analysis, it will define the six attributes of an actionable insight—a key ingredient of any data story . It will examine the exploratory and explanatory steps in the analysis process that shape how stories are formed. The chapter will also discuss the discipline that’ s needed to develop sound insights and not overwhelm audiences with too much information. Chapter 6 : Narrative: The Structur e of Y our Data Story If data experts struggle in one area, it is how to create narratives for their insights. This chapter begins by examining the dif ferent narrative models that are available to us, and then shows you how to craft a data storytelling arc that is based on the familiar dramatic arc introduced by Gustav Freytag. The chapter then explores how to use storyboarding to or ganize your key points into this narrative structure. It also reveals how to insert characters and analogies into your data story to bring it to life. Chapter 7 : Visuals (Part 1): Setting Up the Scenes of Y our Data Story This chapter explores the power of data visualization in relation to storytelling. It examines dif ferent visual perception theories to better understand how humans interpret graphical information. This chapter also focuses on the importance of facilitating comparisons for your audience. You’ll learn the first three key principles of visual storytelling and how they help you establish the visual scenes of your data story . Chapter 8 : Visuals (Part 2): Polishing the Scenes of Y our Data Story After setting up the initial scenes of your data story , this chapter introduces the next four key principles of visual storytelling that help refine and enhance the visual power of your data stories. It will review various tactics on how you can remove unnecessary noise, draw attention to key data points, make your content more approachable, and instill trust in your numbers. Chapter 9 : Crafting Y our Own Data Story In this final chapter , you’ll see how all the data storytelling elements come together in real-world examples. It will walk you through the dif ferent steps and strategies that go into crafting a compelling data story . From these real-world scenarios, you’ll gain a deeper appreciation of how the concepts and principles in this book can be applied to your own insights so you can build compelling narratives that are both fact-based and visually impactful. As everyone continues to be inundated with data, you are going to encounter more and more insights that will need their unique stories to be told. The responsibility for how well they are understood by others and whether they are acted upon falls on each of us."

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Three Essential Elements of Data Stories Maybe stories are just data with a soul. —Brene Brown, research professor and author Data storytelling involves the skillful combination of three key elements: data, narrative , and visuals . Data is the primary building block of every data story . It may sound simple, but a data story should always find its origin in data (more on this in Chapter 4 ), and data should serve as the foundation for the narrative and visual elements of your story . Figure 2.1 highlights the unique, complementary relationship between these three elements as they contribute in distinct ways to the telling of a data story . Explain. When narrative is coupled with data, it helps to explain  to your audience what’ s happening in the data and why a particular insight is important. Ample context and commentary are often needed to fully appreciate an analysis finding."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Figur e 2.1 In data storytelling, all of the different elements—data, narrative, and visuals—complement each other in dif ferent ways. Whether you’re working with data, narrative, or visuals, each element can be powerful individually . You can achieve some level of success with a thought-provoking statistic, a compelling narrative, or stunning data visualization. However , it’s the skilled blend of data, narrative, and visuals in a data story that can harness the unique contributions of all three elements. When you combine the right  visuals and narrative with the right data, you have a data story that can influence and drive change  (see Figure 2.2). Figur e 2.2 When you combine the right data with the right narrative and visuals, you have a data story that can drive change. Essentially , data storytelling is a form of persuasion. It employs data, narrative, and visuals to help an audience see something in a new light and to convince them to act. In his treatise Rhetoric , the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle outlined three key modes of persuasion—ethos, logos, and pathos—which are known as the rhetorical triangle. However , he also mentioned two other forms of persuasion you should be aware of: Ethos —an appeal to credibility Logos —an appeal to logic or reason Pathos —an appeal to emotion T elos—an appeal to purpose Kairos —an appeal to timeliness (opportune moment) While some forms of communication may only rely on a few of these persuasive appeals, a data story depends on all five. As Figure 2.3  shows, a data story closely aligns to each of Aristotle’ s appeals, making it one of the most powerful forms of communication available to us. Figur e 2.3 If we expand the traditional rhetorical triangle to include telos and kairos, we can see how all of these persuasive appeals can come together in a data story , starting at the top with the ethos  of the speaker and moving down to the pathos  (narrative) and logos  (data) appeals to the audience. First, from an ethos  perspective, the success of your data story will be shaped by your own credibility and the trustworthiness of your data. Second, because your data story is based on facts and figures, the logos appeal will be integral to your message. Third, as you weave the data into a convincing narrative, the pathos  or emotional appeal makes your message more engaging. Fourth, having a visualized insight at the core of your message adds the telos  appeal, as it sharpens the focus and purpose of your communication. Fifth, when you share a relevant data story with the right audience at the right time (kair os), your message can be a powerful catalyst for change. I believe Aristotle would have been impressed by the persuasiveness of data storytelling. Driving Action with Data Stories If you wish to influence an individual or a group to embrace a particular value in their daily lives, tell them a compelling story . —Annette Simmons, storyteller and author Several years ago, I got an unexpected taste of the power of data storytelling and its potential for influencing change when I worked with a business-to-business marketing department for a lar ge technology company . Each month, as an external consultant, I would prepare and deliver a monthly analysis of their online marketing sites and campaigns. After reviewing their key metrics for the previous month, I would then share the results of a couple of exploratory analyses. Because I had never met this marketing team in person and our interactions were mainly limited to the monthly call, it was dif ficult to gauge their interest in the findings I shared each month."

After I shared this insight, I didn’ t get any reaction from the customer .

Lawyers are often faced with the dif ficult challenge of assembling a story or narrative from a set of facts.

The focus of their study was a real 1983 criminal case involving a Boston bar fight that resulted in a stabbing death."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"By adding relevant visuals to a data story , you tap into the most effective method for transmitting information to other human beings. Stanford Professor Robert E. Horn noted that when visual elements are closely intertwined with words, they of fer “the potential for increasing human ‘bandwidth,’ or the capacity to take in, comprehend, and more efficiently synthesize lar ge amounts of new information” (Horn 2001). For this reason, data visualizations play an integral role in the sharing of data insights and the formation of data stories. The most dominant sense that we have as human beings is vision. It’ s estimated more than 50% of the brain is focused on processing visual stimuli—outpacing the processing spent on our other four senses combined (Hagen 2012). As early as 1894, Professor E.A."

When we’re convinced of the strength of our findings, we say “the facts speak for themselves.” In other words, if people are simply exposed to the same numbers as we were, they will be equally enlightened. In these situations, we expect rational human beings to appreciate the soundness of our well-founded insights, arrive at the same conclusions, and be equally motivated to pursue a logical course of action.

However , no matter how strong or sound your data is, there’ s no guarantee it will resonate in their minds. When you share new facts with an audience, the data must traverse through both systems of the brain. Y ou are not just engaging with the reasoning side of the brain (System 2) but also the emotional one (System 1)."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Data storytelling provides a bridge between the worlds of logic and emotion. A data story of fers a safe passage for your insights to travel around emotional pitfalls and through analytical resistance that typically impede facts. Rather than working against  System 1, stories work with the emotional, intuitive side of the brain to assist System 2 in considering new insights. The Storytelling Animal  author , Jonathan Gottschall, underscored the unique influence stories have over us in the following statement: When we read dry , factual ar guments, we read with our dukes up. W e are critical and skeptical."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"While a story can act as a powerful delivery agent for sharing facts, the intent of data storytelling should never be to deceive an audience . Just like falsifying data is unacceptable, using narrative in a manipulative manner is similarly irresponsible. Instead, data storytelling should be viewed as a means of making insights more compatible with the human mind and more conducive to comprehension and retention. Rather than comparing storytelling to a negative Greek tale of lies and deception, I prefer to relate it to a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) express lane in a major city . If you were responsible for transporting goods across a busy, gridlocked city , you would jump at the chance to use the express lanes as often as you could to avoid congested, slow-moving roadways. Not only would the travel times be reduced, but your trips would be far less stressful."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Without data storytelling, your insights are left to the whims of how Systems 1 and 2 typically process unfamiliar information, which can lead to unwanted delays, detours, and road closures for your ideas. Figur e 3.14 When you share insights with data stories, you’re able to take advantage of the special express lane that the brain reserves for narrative. In 201 1, the Skeptical Science website’ s John Cook and psychologist Stephan Lewandowsky published a short, practical guide on how to counter misinformation and the backfire ef fect called The Debunker ’s Handbook (Cook and Lewandowsky 201 1). In the guide, they explore why people don’t always process information rationally , and why it can be dif ficult for people to modify their existing knowledge. Although the book’ s original intent was to help address climate change denial, its concepts can be applied to any number of myths or misperceptions."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Graphics provide more clarity and less opportunity for misinterpretation. (Cook and Lewandowsky 201 1) When you use visuals to tell your data story , your insights become clearer and more concrete for your audience. While individuals can attempt to interpret the visualized data in various ways, there’ s usually less wriggle room for them to draw misguided conclusions. For example, in a study by Lewandowsky , he found that when surface temperature data was visualized, subjects correctly judged a warming trend regardless of their personal attitudes toward global warming (Lewandowsky 201 1). When you harness the power of data storytelling through data, narrative, and visuals, you give your insights the best chance at overcoming resistance and driving change. A data story has a greater possibility of reaching people’ s hearts—not just their minds—to stir them to act. What Could Semmelweis Have Done Differently? All great truths begin as blasphemies. —Geor ge Bernard Shaw , playwright At the beginning of the chapter , we saw how Ignaz Semmelweis’ s ideas about handwashing were rejected by the nineteenth-century medical establishment. While his passion and determination to help expectant mothers earned him the posthumous title of “Savior of Mothers,” he was unable to convince his peers to embrace his lifesaving hygiene practices."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"However , I believe the principles of data storytelling could have helped him in his attempts to change the dangerous medical practices that were costing the lives of so many young mothers. From a narrative perspective, Semmelweis could have attempted to humanize his data for his audience because insightful statistics alone won’ t persuade skeptical minds. The data-savvy doctor missed an opportunity to weave his handwashing results into a compelling data story that could have connected with his medical colleagues on an emotional level ( pathos appeal). He could have shared the story of Sophie, a poor but healthy , young mother of two small children who arrived at the hospital expecting her third child. Rather than returning home with her beautiful, newborn daughter two days later , Sophie’ s and her infant’ s lifeless bodies were reminders of the daily cost being inflicted by childbed fever . Sophie could be a real patient that Semmelweis’ s team of student doctors encountered at the V ienna maternity clinic or a representative persona that embodied the many women who were needlessly losing their lives to this preventable disease."

This combination can br each the barriers between people and data, engaging the former and delving deeper into the latter . —James Richardson, Research Director at Gartner An ancient Jewish folktale dating back to the eleventh century captures the essence of why we must tell stories with our insights.

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Now , I want to shift the focus to what  exactly a data story is before I dive into how to tell stories with data. W ithout a clear understanding of what a data story is, you’ll have a more challenging time crafting an ef fective one. As data storytelling has grown in popularity , so has the misuse of the term, which can be an obstacle to comprehending what a data story really is. All too often, data storytelling is positioned by various technology vendors and experts as being synonymous with data visualization. This flawed perspective on data storytelling means any data communication that involves data being visualized in some graphical or pictorial manner becomes a data story . We then find ourselves surrounded by “data stories” as visualized data is increasingly shared with us in a multitude of ways: data presentations, reports, dashboards, infographics, interactive apps, standalone data charts, alerts, and so on. However , the mere presence of a data visualization doesn’ t mean a data story is being told or even that one was intended. Data visualization alone is not data storytelling. While visuals are an essential part of data storytelling, data visualizations can serve a variety of purposes from analysis to communication to even art. Most data charts are designed to disseminate information in a visual manner . Only a subset of data compositions is focused on presenting specific insights as opposed to just general information. When most data compositions combine both visualizations and text, it can be dif ficult to discern whether a particular scenario falls into the realm of data storytelling or not. The following continuum (see Figure 4.1 ) introduces five key attribute pairings that can help you to identify situations in which data storytelling does or doesn’ t make sense: Informative versus insightful. Many people view these two words as synonyms and use them interchangeably . However , when you examine their definitions, you discover they’re complementary but mean different things."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"In contrast, when you have a clear , distinct insight, your message can be more focused and more easily formed into an engaging data story . Exploratory versus explanatory . In some cases, you may provide your audience with interactive data visualizations that enable them to explore the data for themselves. Rather than providing them with a predetermined set of findings, you give the audience the freedom to filter and interact with the data to discover their own insights."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"On the other hand, when you have a particular insight in mind, it’ s much easier to explain—in the form of a data story—what your insight is and why it’ s important. Abstract versus concr ete. In some cases, you may decide to share a wide array of information but not wish to steer your audience in a particular direction or toward a specific conclusion. When you keep the data more abstract, it frees up the data to be interpreted in a variety of ways."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"However , by leaving the possibility of having multiple interpretations, you forego the ability to tell a specific data story . In some situations, this tradeof f may be desirable because you don’ t want to limit the ways in which the data can be interpreted. In contrast, when the insights in your data composition are more concrete and specific, it is much easier to build a coherent data story because you are highlighting a particular view of the data. Continuous versus finite. Many data communications, such as automated dashboards, are set up to constantly refresh with new information as it becomes available. Similar to a CCTV camera or TV channel that’ s always on, they are constantly streaming new information."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Figur e 4.1 If a data communication bears more attributes from the right side of the data storytelling continuum, it will likely be a better fit for telling a data story. If it has more attributes from the left side, then it may not be as well-suited for data storytelling. Data storytelling represents one aspect of a lar ger analysis process that we go through to convert data into action. Obviously , before you can communicate an insight, you must find one. Many of the data compositions we create help us—or others—analyze data and pinpoint meaningful insights. Most of the items on the left side of the data storytelling continuum are associated with this initial step of storyframing  (see Figure 4.1). With storyframing, you distill down the vast amount of data to a more targeted set of key metrics and dimensions (see Figure 4.2 ). By limiting what data is focused on and choosing how it is visualized, you frame  the potential stories that can emer ge from the data. For example, if you built an infographic that compared the prices of various vehicles by fuel economy and safety rating data, it would lead people to dif ferent insights than if it focused on acceleration and horsepower data."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Data storytelling  can be defined as a structured approach for communicating data insights using narrative elements and explanatory visuals. Based on this understanding and definition of data storytelling, let’ s take a closer look at the anatomy of a data story . The Six Essential Elements of a Data Story A story is not an accumulation of information strung into a narrative, but a design of events to carry us to a meaningful climax. —Robert McKee, screenwriting expert and author When you are surrounded by all kinds of stories and consuming them on a constant basis, it may be dif ficult to pause and think about what makes a story . . . a story . People often turn to literary and news stories as frames of reference for what a story is. However , these two forms of stories can actually contrast sharply with each other . While narrative journalism found in The New Y orker  magazine or on CBS’ s 60 Minutes  program can mirror many aspects of literary stories, most news stories are focused on informing an audience with a top-down, fact-based approach that typically follows the inverted pyramid method ."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Accordingly , rather than using a news story as the archetype for defining what a data story is, I will rely on the literary story as our model. Before jumping into the specific elements of a data story , we must clarify the definition of a typical literary story . Wikipedia defines a narrative or story as “a report of connected events, real or imaginary , presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, or still or moving images, or both” (Wikipedia 2019). When you consider the books of J.K. Rowling, the plays of W illiam Shakespeare, or the movies of Steven Spielber g, some may question whether stories based on data can even be equated with these types of works."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"However , data stories have more in common with these other forms of stories than you may realize. Many of the attributes found in works of literature, film, and theater can also be present in data stories. You’ll see common traits in the following six essential elements that define a data story . Figur e 4.4  There are six essential elements to a data story . Element 1: Data Foundation The one unique characteristic that separates a data story from other types of stories is its fundamental basis in data. Although other stories may have various facts scattered throughout them, only data stories are derived entirely from data. While I don’ t boast about too many things, I do make a mean batch of chocolate-chip cookies. Just like the quality of a good chocolate-chip cookie depends on the concentration and quality of its chocolate content, a data story hinges on having a fact-based foundation. The building blocks of every data story are quantitative or qualitative data, which are frequently the results of an analysis or insightful observation. Because each data story is formed from a collection of facts, each one represents a work of nonfiction. While some creativity may be used in how the story is structured and delivered, a true data story won’ t stray too far from its factual underpinnings. In addition, the quality and trustworthiness of the data will determine how credible and powerful the data story is. In the next chapter , I’ll take a deeper look at how data serves as the foundation of your data story . Element 2: Main Point In the classic John Hughes comedy Planes, T rains, and Automobiles  (1987), actor Steve Martin plays a harried business executive who is stranded during his trip home before Thanksgiving. His character is stuck with an unwanted travel companion—a chatty traveling salesman played by John Candy . At one point, Martin’ s character gives pointed feedback to Candy’ s character about his penchant for sharing useless anecdotes: You know everything is not an anecdote."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Similarly , a data story must have a central insight or idea— it must have a main point . While you can certainly share dif ferent facts in a data story , they should all support an overarching insight. By focusing on a main point, you ensure your data story has a clear purpose ( telos  appeal). A random collection of interesting but disconnected facts will lack the unifying theme to become a data story—it may be informative, but it won’ t be insightful. For example, you may have uncovered a number of flaws in your company’ s hiring processes. All of these observations can tie into an overall insight that these faulty hiring procedures will end up stalling your company’ s growth this year if they’re not addressed. Any additional insights that don’ t relate to this central message will only detract from it."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"The American writer Mark T wain once said, “A tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere.” The intended endpoint or destination of a data story is to guide an audience toward a better understanding and appreciation of your main point or insight, which hopefully leads to discussion, action, and change. However , if you have several diver gent findings and try to combine them into a single data story , you may run the risk of confusing your audience or overwhelming them with too much information. T o tell a cohesive data story , you must prioritize and limit what you focus on. Sometimes an insight deserves its own data story rather than being appended to the narrative of another insight. Element 3: Explanatory Focus Every data story should have an explanatory emphasis. Frequently , people make the mistake of just describing the data or insights. Being descriptive  is not, however , the same as being explanatory . If you look more closely at the definitions of describe  and explain  there is a subtle but important difference."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Likewise, a data story must go beyond just the descriptive details and seek to clarify how and why something occurred (or will occur). For instance, learning that sales were down 35% year -over -year in the last quarter is informative but not insightful. When you explain how recent marketing mistakes and aggressive moves by competitors contributed to this 35% drop in sales, you’re helping the audience to better understand contextually what’ s behind the sales slump and how they can fix it. A data story will be based on deeper analytical reasoning than just presenting the surface-level details. It’s also significantly more challenging to be explanatory than just descriptive. W e don’ t always have neat and tidy explanations for why or how things happened a certain way . There’ s going to be some degree of uncertainty and speculation."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"As a data storyteller , you need to be comfortable with sharing a point of view based on the best information that’s available to you. Element 4: Linear Sequence Every data story follows a linear sequence in which supporting data points build on each other until a main point or conclusion is reached. The general definition of a story  is “an account of a causally related or connected series of events.” In a story , something notable happens, which triggers an ef fect on someone or something else—cause and ef fect. For example, in the popular children’ s story The W izard of Oz , the protagonist Dorothy Gale encounters an interesting sequence of events—a tornado transports her to a strange land; she is given a pair of magical shoes; she meets some traveling companions while journeying down the Y ellow Brick Road; a wizard sends her and her friends on a mission; and they melt a wicked witch with a pail of water (see Figure 4.5 ). Independently , these interesting events wouldn’ t amount to much, but sequentially , they create a powerful tale that is loved by multiple generations."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"In the case of data stories, you are unfolding a series of supporting data points that lead to a central insight. Instead of unloading all of the information on the audience at the same time, the data is exposed to them in stages. Each new detail should build on the previous ones, and through this sequential process the audience steadily gains an appreciation of the central issue or opportunity . Depending on how you share the data, the layout or presentation flow should provide a clear , sequential path for the audience to follow your points."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"Data stories share similar dramatic fundamentals—setting, plot, characters, and so on—to those used in literature and film. In data stories, the application of these elements may not be the same or as obvious, but they are equally important. Just as the Up directors established the setting for their story with ample background information, you must also provide sufficient contextual details in order for your audience to properly grasp your insights. T o set up a data story , you may need the audience to understand the time frame, data sources, past performance, and other details for context. For example, $2 million in sales in the last quarter may be bad or great depending on what the sales results were like in the same quarter last year . From a plot perspective, good  writers and directors never include random, unrelated events in their stories. Each event serves a purpose in advancing the story and developing the characters."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Similarly , how you structure and sequence the information forms the backbone of your data story . Sometimes, what is left out is just as critical to the story’ s success as what is included. Although you may not believe a data story can have characters, the data that’ s being analyzed is often about people: customers, prospects, employees, partners, students, patients, voters, and so on. By highlighting the people behind the numbers, you add a more relatable human perspective to your data story . The more you incorporate dramatic elements into your data story , the more engaging it becomes for an audience on an emotional level. In Chapter 6 , I will explore the dif ferent ways in which these dramatic elements come together to form a narrative structure for your data story . Element 6: V isual Anchors In the late 1920s, the film industry transitioned from silent films to talking pictures. Many people don’ t realize the influential English filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock’ s first 10 movies were actually silent pictures in which he was able to hone his visual storytelling skills."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"While not all literary forms of story require visual imagery , data stories must often be visually anchored. Because human beings are visual creatures, the visual depictions of the data end up being more powerful than just words or numbers. Mark T wain of fered advice to other writers when he said, “Don’ t say the old lady screamed—bring her on and let her scream.” While data charts are frequently used in the analysis process to discover the insights, they can play an integral role in explaining them as well. W ith raw statistics being complex and dif ficult to comprehend, visualizing the numbers can make them more approachable and consumable for an audience (see Figure 4.7 )."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"In Chapters 7  and 8, I will show how visuals shape the critical scenes of your data story . Figur e 4.7  Following Mark Twain’ s argument that it’s better to bring on the old lady and “let her scream” than to state “the old lady screamed,” it’s also often far more compelling to visualize the data than to merely state it. All six of these elements are essential to creating an ef fective data story . If you ignore any of the components—no matter how compelling or interesting your data is—your analysis results end up being just information and you miss out on the many benefits that can be gained when the data is woven into a story . Now , some data stories will adhere more closely and deeply to the six elements than others. The more comprehensive ones will look and feel more like literary stories, whereas others with a lighter dose of the six elements may benefit simply from being more “storylike” in their delivery . Data Stories Come in All Shapes and Sizes Stories are memory aids, instruction manuals, and moral compasses. —Aleks Krotoski, psychologist and journalist Just as every insight will be slightly dif ferent, each data story will be unique. There is no set length for how long a data story will be, as it will depend on the information that is to be shared. Ideally , you should strive to tell the data story as concisely and clearly as possible, but the nature of your discovery and its intended audience will ultimately shape the breadth and depth of the narrative. Frequently , the delivery method you choose can shape and influence how well you are able to tell a story with your data. Although we have many different ways of sharing information, they are not all equally well-suited to data storytelling and could potentially be geared more toward storyframing. Using the framework outlined above, you can see how certain types of data communications struggle to meet all of the essential criteria ( Figure 4.8 ). Figur e 4.8 All of these communications are based on data, but not all of them are equally conducive to data storytelling. Currently , the automated forms of data communication (near the bottom of the table) can’ t support many of the essential elements of a data story . In the future, we will see an influx of artificial intelligence and machine learning attempting to bridge this gap, but it will be some time before storytelling can be fully automated in a significant way—if ever . While technology can make significant inroads into enhancing storyframing, it’ s too early to say what role it will play in actual data storytelling. For example, an automated dashboard can highlight random anomalies in the data, but no narrative really emer ges until someone (or some intelligent agent) connects the dots and interprets what’ s happening. In the field of data journalism, new interactive forms of data storytelling have emer ged in the form of scrollers and steppers. Scrollers— sometimes referred to as scrollytelling—reveal the content as the user scrolls down a page. The digital publication The Pudding (https://pudding.cool ), features a variety of scrollers or “visual essays” on a wide array of cultural topics. Steppers require the user to click through the steps or scenes of a story and are quite popular with major media sites such as the New Y ork T imes, W all Str eet Journal , and Vox."

In the case of data visualizations and infographics, the limited depth and sometimes static nature of the content can make it more challenging to meet all of the criteria. One of the most famous examples of an ef fective infographic is Charles Joseph Minard’ s map of Napoleon’ s Russian campaign of 1812 ( Figure 4.9 ).

Every Data Story Needs a Storyteller Every story is complicated until it finds the right storyteller . —Anonymous In the previous chapter , we saw how the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis failed to turn his life-saving discovery into a compelling data story . Nobody can question his dedication to the medical profession nor his passion to help save the lives of young mothers.

During the outset of the Crimean W ar (1853–1856), news reports of the horrendous treatment of wounded soldiers had stirred up public outrage, and the British government was eager to address the issue. Nightingale was asked to lead a group of 38 female nurses to improve the poor conditions at a British army hospital in Scutari, T urkey . Her nursing team encountered what Nightingale referred to as “the kingdom of hell”— an overcrowded, filthy hospital that lacked basic medical supplies, proper sanitation, and reliable record keeping."

This hybrid presentation is often used to address both direct and indirect communication needs: a slide deck to be delivered in person (direct) and a detailed report to be shared as a standalone reference or handout (indirect).

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"In the future, technology may assume the role of data storyteller in the form of intelligent agents that craft meaningful data stories from disparate data sources. In 1950, English mathematician Alan T uring developed the T uring test, which tests whether a computer exhibits intelligence that is indistinguishable from that of a human. While machines can mimic some of the required tasks involved with data storytelling, it will be some time before they can equal the natural storytelling ability of human beings. Part of the delay is that many technology companies don’ t yet appear to understand what data storytelling really entails. For example, natural language generation (NLG) vendors tout the ability for their tools to translate data into text. Interestingly , they position data visualizations as being confusing or overwhelming, and they suggest people prefer automated text they can read. However , descriptive text that outlines in minutes what a well-designed chart can communicate in seconds doesn’ t represent the dawn of automated data storytelling. It’ s like advocating for WiFi-enabled fax machines because email isn’ t working. While advanced NLG technology will be a key element of future data storytelling agents, its focus will need to expand from simply describing  data to explaining  it—a much higher standard to achieve. We are beginning to see glimpses of automated storytelling’ s potential. In November 2017 at Amazon’ s AWS re:Invent conference, technology firm AGT/HEED announced their partnership with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) league to leverage the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide more compelling fight coverage (Bradley 2018). By collecting real-time data from sensors in the fighters’ gloves and octagon floor , video cameras, and audio microphones, AGT/HEED founder Mati Kochavi indicated the platform could generate 70 dif ferent insights from a single fight (see Figure 4.15 )."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"For now , human beings are still the dominant storytellers, but we will see technology increasingly used to augment our storytelling abilities, helping us to both discover and tell better , richer data stories. Know Your Audience before Telling Your Story You’ve got to keep your finger on the pulse of what your audience is thinking and know what they’ll accept from you. –Dwayne Johnson, actor One of the critical mistakes you can make as a data storyteller is to not know your audience. In fact, nothing can ruin a good data story faster than a disconnect between you and your audience. While we may not always recognize it, the audience plays an influential role in shaping a data story’ s focus and direction. T o illustrate this point, let’ s pretend you’ve been asked to host a movie night for a group of Robin Hood fans you don’ t know . While there is a wide selection of Robin Hood movies to choose from (see Figure 4.16 ), it’s difficult to pick the right one when you don’ t know your audience. Even though the movies all focus on the same tale of the famous English outlaw , each one tells the same story in a unique way that appeals to a specific audience."

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Second, you need to consider how your data story must be tailored for the intended audience. There are eight audience considerations that can influence how you approach your data story: 1. Key goals and priorities. If you understand what matters to your audience, you can ensure your data story is relevant and meaningful to them. No matter how interesting or unique your insights are, they must relate to things your audience cares about. For example, if your tar get audience is a group of executives who are focused on improving company sales, you will be hard-pressed to win their attention with topics unrelated to sales performance. It is important to make sure you are aligned with your audience’ s key objectives and strategic priorities so you don’ t waste anyone’ s time—yours or theirs. 2."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"A keen awareness of your audience’ s beliefs and preferences can help direct and streamline your data storytelling. 3. Specific expectations. When you share a data story , an audience may have a preconceived notion of what will be covered and have specific questions they would like to see answered. If you’re not mindful of these expectations, the disconnect between you and your audience can become frustrating and lead to disappointment on both sides. Whenever possible, you must try to anticipate your audience’ s questions and weave thoughtful answers into your data story . If there’ s ever a mismatch between their expectations and what your data story covers, you may want to reevaluate the focus of your data story . 4. Opportune timing. In Chapter 2 , kairos was introduced as another form of persuasion from Aristotle’ s Rhetoric  that emphasizes the importance of recognizing the right time and place to present an argument or idea.

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Depending on the circumstances, you may want to be more forward about sharing your data story if the interest is high or wait for a more opportune time when more pressing questions or concerns have been addressed. 5. Topic familiarity . Audiences will have dif ferent levels of domain knowledge and expertise. If your audience is less familiar with the subject matter of your data story than you are, you may need to spend time explaining key concepts and providing ample context before delving into your insights. For example, if your audience knows very little about mobile marketing—the focus of your analysis—you may need to provide some background information before revealing how it can be optimized. However , if your audience already has a deep knowledge of mobile marketing, you can dive directly into your insights. Their familiarity with the topic could also lead to deeper questions and the need for more detailed information on your insights. 6."

Just imagine creating an executive summary for Shakespeare’ s Romeo and Juliet : “Both of the title characters kill themselves due to a miscommunication and unfortunate timing” would surely ruin the epic tale for most people. In Chapter 6 , I’ll discuss a strategy on how to address this executive summary challenge. 8. Audience mix."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Alternatively , you may decide it would be best to present a tailored version of the data story to each group separately . Data visualization expert Edward T ufte once said, “If the statistics are boring, then you’ve got the wrong numbers.” While this may be true in some situations, in others, you may simply have the wrong audience  for your numbers. The critical question is: How well do you know your audience? The more you know about your audience, the more you’ll be able to tailor your data story’ s content to their needs and interests. If you realize you don’ t really know your audience, you may want to hold of f on sharing your story until you can learn more about them. Knowing your audience will not only influence how you tell your data story but also predicate its success. The Strategic Use of Pr e Meetings Change can be dif ficult in business environments where politics and a lack of buy-in can suppress or kill good ideas. If your insights may be viewed as controversial or disruptive, you may need to use a more measured approach with how you communicate them to overcome resistance and gain support. In these situations, it can be an ef fective strategy to schedule pre meetings selectively with key individuals to review the findings before you present them in a group setting."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"In addition, during the process of meeting with these dif ferent individuals, you’ll receive invaluable feedback that can inform how your data story can be strengthened and refined.

When It Makes Sense to Craft Data Stories and When It Doesn’t Storytelling is the essential human activity . The harder the situation, the more essential it is. —Tim O’Brien, author Data stories are powerful tools for sharing insights. However , not all insights need to be crafted into narratives. It takes time and ef fort to prepare and craft a data story—after you may have already spent hours analyzing the data to find your key insight. Rather than saying every insight requires “its story to be told,” you can be selective based on the nature of each discovery . Clearly , the value  of the insight is an important determinant in whether a particular finding merits being turned into a data story . For example, if a business insight could help your or ganization save a significant amount of money , it’s most likely going to be worth your time to build out a data story for it. However , not even all high-value insights necessarily need to be made into full-fledged data stories. Y ou must also consider how easy or har d the insight will be for the audience to understand and accept. Before you build out a data story for your insight, consider the following criteria that could influence your approach: Agreeable versus unpleasant. If your findings are favorable or acceptable to your audience, they won’ t need much convincing or persuading to accept them. However , as we saw in the previous chapter , people will primarily scrutinize data they don’ t like. For example, if the analysis of a new employee retention program showed it’s inef fective, it’ s going to be harder for the people who developed and implemented the program to accept the poor results than for those who advocated for an entirely dif ferent approach."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"W ithout a data story to lean on, this team may struggle to grasp why the new capability wasn’ t better received. Simple versus complex. If an insight is fairly simple or straightforward to grasp, it may not need to be built into a data story . In fact, doing so may actually interfere with its ability to communicate in a direct manner . On the other hand, for a complicated, multifaceted issue, the audience may require more help and guidance from an expert to understand it. Using a data story , you can break down a complex insight into more manageable chunks so it is easier for the audience to follow and comprehend. Safe versus risky . When an insight highlights a change that is safe for the audience to make, you will see fewer concerns about embracing it. For example, if an insight aligns with the CEO’ s current viewpoint, her leadership team will be more willing to pursue it."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"The higher the risk—either from a personal or or ganizational perspective—the more people will need to be persuaded by a data story to accept the numbers. Inexpensive versus costly . Some insights can be relatively inexpensive to pursue and implement. In these situations, very little persuasion is required because most people will feel foolish to not act on these types of insights."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Indeed, a data story may represent the only fighting chance that a counterintuitive insight has—sadly something I didn’ t discover until later in my career . American mythologist Joseph Campbell said, “If you’re going to have a story , have a big story , or none at all.” The same philosophy applies to your insights in terms of data storytelling. If you have a big (valuable) insight to share, there’ s a good chance it’ s going to require a data story in order for it to be properly understood and accepted. In fact, between the insight’ s potential impact and what type of insight it is (hard vs. easy), there’ s a sweet spot called the Story Zone  where data storytelling excels (see Figure 4.17). It spans an area where the insight is “medium-to-high” in value and falls into the “hard” category for the reasons listed above. While there’ s no guarantee that a data story can overcome all the factors of resistance, it represents the best chance you have at persuading your audience with numbers. Figur e 4.17 When an insight falls into the Story Zone  (Hard/Med-High), it should be comm unicated as a data story . If it falls outside of the Story Zone , it is questionable if it should be told as a data story . It may not merit the extra time and ef fort (Hard/Low), or it may not necessarily need a data story to be understood and embraced (Easy/Med-High). If you recall, in the personal experience I shared at the very beginning of this book I discovered an insight that challenged an entrenched practice of the ecommerce group for whom I was working. The survey data indicated customers didn’ t require or appreciate a specific shipping option that was provided to them. I would conservatively consider such an insight to be of at least medium value."

One of the essential attributes of a data story is a central or main insight. W ithout a main point, your data story will lack purpose, direction, and cohesion. A central insight is the unifying theme (telos  appeal) that ties your various findings together and guides your audience to a focal point or climax for your data story . However , when you have an increasing amount of data at your disposal, insights can be elusive.

Once a meaningful insight is uncovered, explanatory data visualizations are used to tell the story . If you’re familiar with the action-adventure films by Geor ge Lucas and Steven Spielber g, you’ll know Indiana (Indy) Jones as a rough-and-tumble, bullwhip-toting archeologist in the 1930s. As Indy pursued rare antiquities around the world, he would often find trouble and battle a variety of evil henchmen along the way ."

For example, the data cut  is strong on data but is weak in both narrative and visuals. The data cameo  is rich in narrative but short on data. The data decoration  offers appealing (if not particularly clear or meaningful) visuals but lacks a focused narrative."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Only a true data story combines all three key aspects—data, narrative and visuals—ef fectively . It is imperative that you understand how a data story is properly formed because it will make a difference in the ef fectiveness of your data communications. Analyzing and Communicating Data Demands Discipline It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. —Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author Even with a solid narrative and insightful visuals, a data story cannot overcome a weak data foundation. As the master architect, builder , and designer of your data story , you play an instrumental role in ensuring its truthfulness, quality , and ef fectiveness. Because you are responsible for pouring the data foundation and framing the narrative structure of your data story , you need to be careful during the analysis process. Because all of the data is being processed and interpreted by you before it is shared with others, it can be exposed to cognitive biases and logical fallacies that distort or weaken the data foundation of your story . In Chapter 3 , we saw how the human mind processes information both unconsciously and consciously using two systems—System 1 and System 2."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"While modern psychology currently lists more than 180 cognitive biases, I will focus on three common, representative examples that demonstrate how cognitive bias can distort your data stories in various ways. Confirmation Bias Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for and accept only evidence that supports your existing beliefs or views. It also causes you to ignore contrary information that refutes your existing opinions. American businessman W arren Buf fett noted, “What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.” When you begin an analysis, you may have an opinion or hypothesis about the subject matter you’re analyzing."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"When data must be filtered through you—an intelligent but fallible human being—there’ s always the possibility that biased or flawed reasoning can twist and contort your data stories. While I’ve covered some key cognitive biases and logical fallacies, there are hundreds of others that can also lead you astray . Many people don’ t realize how much discipline  is required in the analysis process. Theoretical physicist Richard Feynman said, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool” (Feynman 1974)."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"If you want to build an ef fective data story , you need to be aware of the potential biases or prejudices that can (and will) af fect your judgment. While you won’ t be able to disable them like features on your smartphone, you can be on guard for them during the analysis process. Data visualization expert and author of The T ruthful Art  Alberto Cairo acknowledged how challenging this can be: It’s true that human beings can’ t be completely factual or objective.

When Too Much of a Good Thing Is Bad A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention. —Herbert A.

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"As you assemble the various elements of your data story , you’ll want to be mindful of the importance of “chunking” your information in a manageable fashion. In the next chapter , you’ll see how narrative can add structure to your data and make it easier to digest for your audience. Educators and instructional designers face a similar challenge as data storytellers in terms of finding the right balance of information that imparts key insights and concepts to an audience but doesn’ t overwhelm the audience members either . In the late 1980s, educational psychologist John Sweller examined the working memory’ s limited capacity and explored the reasons why people found it dif ficult to understand and retain new information."

While you can’ t necessarily simplify the complexity of the subject matter you’ve analyzed, you can manage  the impact of its intrinsic load. One useful tactic is to break up your findings into more manageable segments or chunks that your audience can more easily absorb and follow . Rather than dumping too much data on your audience too quickly , you can reveal the data gradually in stages so they can build schemas as they become familiar with your information."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"An essential goal in ef fective data storytelling is to minimize the extraneous load that is placed on an audience. The data for gery—the data cut —is an example of how extraneous cognitive load can derail a data communication. When you share unedited, raw findings, your audience is forced to work harder to understand and appreciate them. Any mental ef fort the audience members waste on extraneous items reduces their capacity to focus on your core message."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"When appropriate, you may consider incorporating analogies into your data stories to make complex concepts more approachable and comprehensible for your audience. In addition, rather than relying only on high-level, aggregated results, you may want to include specific, concrete examples that can help bring your overall findings to life for your audience. For example, you might have uncovered a customer service issue that is af fecting thousands of customers and costing your company millions of dollars. However , it might be even more impactful to share a specific example of how the issue is impacting one of your most valuable customers."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"When you share too much information, your data story can crumble under the sheer weight of your data. As you shift from exploratory to explanatory phases in the analysis process, you’re often going to have more data than you actually need to tell a single story . American writer Henry David Thoreau said, “It’ s not what you look at that matters, it’ s what you see.” While you may have analyzed or looked at a lot of data, it’ s really only the insights that matter—what you saw that stood out. Researchers Nadav Klein and Ed O’Brien discovered we tend to overestimate how much information someone needs to see before making a decision (Klein and O’Brien 2018)."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"These expectation gaps indicate that your data stories may need far less information than you think they do— maybe even less than half the evidence your intuition (System 1) is telling you to include . When you evaluate the data foundation for your story , it’s important to separate the essential from the extraneous. Y our goal shouldn’ t be to show how much work you did or how smart you were in your data exploration. Your goal should be to tell a memorable story based on your key findings."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Even before you build your data story , you can deprioritize data that is unnecessary and isolate key data points that may be useful to your narrative. As New Y ork T imes graphics editor Amanda Cox stated, “Data isn’ t like your kids, you don’ t have to pretend to love them equally .” Some of your data points are going to be more important to your story than others. As you reduce the competing noise, you’ll find the signal of your story will strengthen. As the English author Henry Green noted, “The more you leave out, the more you highlight what you leave in.” In fact, as you assemble your key points into a story , you’ll find the narrative structure will further help you in isolating which data points to focus on."

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"While piecing together a series of facts into a meaningful story may not be the same as crafting a fictional story , the time-tested dramatic structure can be adapted and applied to data storytelling. In the journey to find a narrative approach for data storytelling, I encountered three common narrative models: 1. Aristotle’ s Tragedy Structur e. The Greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the first to examine the basic structure and rules of drama in his book Poetics . For Aristotle, the plot—the or ganization of a sequence of incidents or events—was the “soul” of a story ."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"As I evaluated each of the narrative models in terms of data storytelling, I felt like Goldilocks in the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Thr ee Bears . I found Aristotle’ s beginning-middle-end structure to be too simple, as it didn’ t provide enough direction on how to construct a story . Without more definition around the narrative structure, you could say multiple things—a report or a textbook—have a beginning, middle, and end, but that clearly doesn’ t make them stories. At the other end of the spectrum, I found Campbell’ s Hero’ s Journey with its multiple stages to be too complicated for assembling data stories. While it might be helpful for screenwriters and novelists, it’ s too complex to be useful for data storytellers. Like Goldilocks, I found the middle option—Freytag’ s Pyramid—to be “just right” in terms of detail and ease of use. Using Freytag’ s Pyramid as a foundation, I developed a four -stage narrative structure called the Data Storytelling Arc (see Figure 6.4 ). Figur e 6.4 The Data Storytelling Arc uses Freytag’ s Pyramid as a foundation for how to tell stories with data in four steps. In a traditional literary story , the exposition would introduce the setting details (location, timeframe, situation) and main characters (appearance, personality , background). At the beginning of a data story , it’s important to establish key details such as the area of focus and time period. While you may not have actual characters in your data story , you may have a segment of people such as customers, employees, investors, and so on that you will focus on. The Setting  of your data story should provide the audience with “just enough” background information so they can easily grasp the data you share with them. Many analysts make the mistake of beginning their data story with an in-depth summary of their entire analysis process. While this approach provides a significant amount of context, the extra detail can easily overwhelm your audience and should be relegated to an appendix. Most audiences will not care about the steps or process you used to find your insights—they’re more curious about what you discovered."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"A key part of the Setting phase is the Hook , which is a data story’ s equivalent of the inciting incident. While the rest of the information in the Setting provides crucial background information, the Hook is a notable observation that acts as a turning point in the story and begins to reveal a problem or opportunity (sort of a “hmm moment”). The combination of the contextual information and the Hook creates a powerful juxtaposition. Y our audience should understand what’ s normal or expected so they can appreciate something that’ s extraordinary ."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"For example, a significant spike or dip in the daily results for a key metric can serve as the opening teaser of your data story . After the Hook has introduced something notable or unusual to the audience, the next stage is the Rising Insights  phase, in which the subject of your analysis is explored at a deeper level. Rather than of fering up a loose collection of random facts, the goal is to peel back the layers of the problem or opportunity in a directed, focused manner . You want to include only the information that is necessary to advance the desired narrative because less relevant or tangential findings will weaken your data story . Eventually , you will reach a climax, or the Aha Moment,  of your data story —this is when you share the main finding or central insight. It provides a clear insight, not just an interesting observation as the Hook does. How much time you spend in the Rising Insights stage will depend on your Aha Moment and how much build-up it requires. Some central insights may be fairly straightforward to explain, but others may need multiple supporting details for the audience to fully understand or accept."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"But just because you’ve shared your Aha Moment with your audience, that doesn’ t mean your data story is complete. Just like a literary story doesn’ t end directly after its climax, your data story must continue forward and share how the audience should leverage the new insight. In order to drive action and change, the last Solution and Next Steps  stage is essential to effective data storytelling . If you don’ t guide your audience through the different options they have, they may not know what to do after being enlightened by your findings. If you’re not proactive with suggesting a potential solution or discussing next steps, the opportunity to drive change may be lost. To demonstrate how analysis results can be assembled into a data story with this narrative model, let’ s turn to a simple ecommerce example. Rather than using real charts, I’ll use pseudo charts to not get caught up in the visualization details (see Figure 6.5 ). In the Setting stage, you can see how the total online sales follow a cyclical pattern each quarter . This year ’s sales (blue) have been trending above the previous year ’s results in every period until recently ."

Figur e 6.5 The ecommerce data story shows how insights in each of the four stages combine to form a meaningful data story . Depen ding on the length or compl exity of your story, you may have several rising  insights or none at all. The first Rising Insight highlights how the dark gray product categories are outperforming the results of the previous year . However , the three orange product categories are underperforming last year ’s results."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Through this simplified example, you’ve seen how all of the stages of the narrative model work together to form a compelling data story . How Does the Data Storytelling Ar c Compar e with Other Communication Models? While I’ve primarily focused on fiction-based models for narrative structure, you may have come across other communication models for structuring business information. When I was preparing a data storytelling workshop for a business client, the employees were already accustomed to forming their business presentations in a manner that conformed to one of these models. After some research and comparison, I found that the Data Storytelling Ar c is compatible with a variety of business communication models. Each of the models I found had three stages, similar to Aristotle’ s model. As shown in Figure 6.6 , you can tailor your data story to work within these structures if needed. Figur e 6.6  Many business communication models can be aligned with the Data Storytelling Arc. Fleshing Out Your Narrative with Story Points Plot is what happens in your story . Every story needs structure, just as everybody needs a skeleton. It is how you “flesh out and clothe” your structure that makes each story unique. —Caroline Lawrence, author Now that we have a basic narrative structure to follow , we can begin assembling the data points to fill out your data story . In literature and film, writers string together various plot points to advance their stories. These plot points are the twists, turns, and other developments in a story that move the characters through the narrative arc. For example, a plot point might be a memorable scene in which the hero is first trained by a mentor , meets a love interest, or witnesses a villain defeating an ally ."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Similarly , your data story will be crafted from a series of key data points, which I will refer to as story points . From your Hook to the Aha Moment to your recommendations, the story points will shape and inform the various scenes of your data story . How many story points you have will depend on the depth or breadth of your data story . Generally , only a small portion of data points from your analysis will become actual story points. Most of your story points will come from the key findings or insights that caught your attention during the exploratory analysis phase. Other story points may simply provide context or supporting details to help form a coherent narrative, especially as Rising Insights."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"In 2015, former T ableau evangelist Ben Jones identified seven dif ferent data story types; I found these useful in defining the various types of story points (Jones 2015). Modifying and expanding on Jones’ s seven variants, I settled on nine common types of story points (see Figure 6.7 ). While there may be other types of story points, this initial set should cover the most common forms: 1. Change over time  focuses on how a metric shifts over time."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"As you look to craft your data story , you need to be mindful of your narrative’ s flow and whether your story points form a cohesive story . Being familiar with the various types of story points can give you another perspective on how your data story should be formed. For example, if you were to examine the story point types used in the ecommerce data story above, you’ll see how dif ferent types of story points are utilized to form the data story (see Figure 6.8 ). Figur e 6.8 The ecommerce  data story used various types of story points to convey its message. While you may use only a few of the types on a regular basis, it is helpful to know the full breadth of options you have. Now that you better understand the concepts of a narrative structure and story points, you’re ready to learn how storyboarding can help or ganize your story points into an ef fective storyline. Storyboarding Your Data Story The storyboard’ s primary value is that it forces you to have a reason for , and a consistent approach to, everything you do. —David Becker , eLearning consultant In the early 1930s, the W alt Disney Studio introduced the use of storyboards to plan the sequence of scenes for its animated films. T oday , the technique has been adopted for other situations—such as live-action films, presentations, training courses, and so on. When you’re planning the structure of your data story , storyboarding can help you or ganize the flow of your story points and determine what is essential to your data story . Whether you use sticky notes, a notepad, or a whiteboard, storyboarding helps you to determine which findings need to be a part of your story and how best to sequence them. It also helps you identify potential gaps where you may need to gather more supporting data. In a team scenario, where multiple individuals might be providing dif ferent story points, the storyboard provides a unifying vision to tie together all of the contributions into a cohesive data story . Too often, the tendency is for people to dive in and “just start creating.” When you jump into visualizing your data story too quickly without storyboarding, you pass up an essential opportunity to step back and consider what the overall narrative structure should look like. The process of storyboarding helps you craft a tighter , more impactful narrative, but it can also be a big time-saver . Instead of wasting an inordinate amount of time generating content that may or may not be included in your data story , you can pinpoint beforehand what exactly is needed. While simpler data stories may not require much storyboarding, you can’ t afford to skip this important method of pre-visualizing your narrative when it is complex with multiple story points. Before getting into the four -step process for storyboarding, I want to emphasize its primary purpose is to build a story —not to determine which data visualizations you’re going to create. Until you’ve established the flow of your data story , focusing on the data visualizations will only be a distraction. While you may have some rough ideas about how you’ll visualize your information, it’ s better to suspend any in-depth visualization work until you have your narrative structure in place. Depending on how your story points come together , you may find an interesting data chart from your exploratory analysis is no longer essential to your story . With this perspective in mind, let’ s begin with the first step in the storyboarding process."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Figur e 6.9  The first step in storyboarding your data story is to identify your Aha Moment. Whenever you can attach a monetary value to your major finding, you make it significantly more concrete for your audience. Most decision makers think in terms of money—revenues, profits, costs, investments, and so on. Therefore, you want to quantify what the insight will mean to their profit and loss (P&L) statement, equity , budget, or bank account."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"For the ecommerce data story I shared in the previous section, the Aha Moment could be conveyed as follows: Due to poor sales of Brand X, we’r e going to miss our quarterly sales target by 38%, which puts our entir e team’ s performance bonuses in jeopar dy. If you’re unable to explain your Aha Moment in a single sentence or two, you may not have found your central insight yet, or you haven’ t fully determined why your audience should care about it. When you can distill down your insight to a concise statement that is clear and persuasive, you’re better positioned to see your data story succeed. The reason you start with the Aha Moment is to verify you have something that even merits a data story . In addition, when you start with the end in mind, you know where you need to take your audience. Ultimately , you want your audience to draw the same conclusions from your analysis as you did, and having a clear destination will help you to design the right path. Every proceeding story point can be weighed and measured in its ability to advance the story toward the climax or Aha Moment."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Step 2 : Find Y our Beginning (the Hook and Setting) After you’ve determined where you need to take your audience, you must then determine where your data story begins (see Figure 6.10 ) and establish the Hook (first) and Setting (second). Until you identify your Hook, you won’ t know what you need to cover in your Setting to properly frame it. In attempting to tell their data story , many analysts mistakenly retrace the steps of their analysis ef forts. In painstaking detail, they explain everything they looked at before they eventually found something noteworthy . This approach, which I call the Analysis Journey , may stem from an unconscious desire to establish the accuracy of the data or to show how clever or thorough they were in their analysis. However , it doesn’ t resonate with most audiences who just want to “eat the cake”—not hear about its ingredients or the recipe steps."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"In storyboarding, the reason you start by identifying the Aha Moment and not the Hook is to ensure you have the most important part of the data story covered—the central insight. Even with a compelling hook, your narrative can meander and lead to nowhere without a clear destination (Aha Moment). In some cases, a potential Hook for your data story may have originated from your audience. For example, a leader may have spotted an anomaly or trend in a report and questioned what it meant. A data point that piqued someone’ s curiosity can be used as the entry point to your data story in the following way: Recently , you noticed our fourth-quarter sales numbers are trending below last year ’s results by 28%. I’d like to show you how this trend could have a significant impact on . . . However , in other cases, your analysis may not have been prompted by an audience member ’s questions about a data point. In these scenarios, you will need to comb through your findings and reflect on what initially caught your attention during the analysis phase."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Similarly , you can draw your audience into your data story by contrasting “what is” with “what was” after a significant change occurred. For example, a company may be accustomed to retaining 85% of its customers. However , a few weeks ago, the retention rate dipped to 68% (a 20% decrease). This type of juxtaposition provides both context and the Hook."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Each data story will be dif ferent, so there isn’ t a single pattern or a required number of story points for the Rising Insights section. Depending on the depth or breadth of the findings from your analysis, you may have multiple Rising Insights or none at all. However , while it is possible to go directly from the Hook to the Aha Moment, most data stories will require some level of supporting data or story points to ensure your audience fully grasps your main insight. Figur e 6.11 The next step is to connect your Hook to your Aha Moment with relevant story points that become the Rising Insights of your data story . Initially , you’ll want to document all of the story points from your analysis that could potentially go into your data story . Next, you’ll want to be selective about which story points become Rising Insights. Anything that doesn’ t fit on the path between your Hook and Aha Moment may not make sense for your data story . The following questions can help you determine which story points to use as Rising Insights: Which supporting data points develop the plot or pr ovide crucial context? Some data points will be critical to understanding the Aha Moment either because they provide deeper insights or add necessary context. Can you pr eemptively addr ess audience questions with your findings?"
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"As with most communications, less is more with data storytelling. As was highlighted at the end of the previous chapter , you may not need as many story points to convey your message as you think you do. Running your story by a colleague may help you identify information that is superfluous to your narrative. As you storyboard your Rising Insights and sequence them in the order in which you’ll share them, you want to ensure your story points form a smooth narrative flow ."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"However , this sort of attention to detail is the dif ference between just sharing your findings and crafting a data story that is both coherent and engaging. Step 4 : Empower Y our Audience to Act After you’ve built out your story to its climax—the Aha Moment—your story still isn’ t finished. If you provide the decision makers in your audience only with an insightful takeaway and nothing more, they may not know what they should do with the new information. Most decision makers will want to weigh options and then make an informed decision."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"A complete  data story provides guidance on how your audience can move forward with your idea or insight. For example, in the ecommerce data story , a cost-benefit analysis of each alternative solution could empower the audience to consider the different options and come to a faster decision on next steps. Along with an analysis of the various alternatives, your audience may also welcome a recommendation on the best solution or path forward. If you’ve done a thorough job of analyzing the data and crafting a story , your audience will value your judgment. While they may not fully agree with your assessment, they will at least be interested in your perspective after you invested significant time and ef fort in preparing the data story . Figur e 6.12 If you’r e lookin g to drive actio n and change, you need to help the audience understand what it can do with your insights by helping them identify a Solution and Next Steps . Even when you’ve examined various options and provided a strong recommendation, your audience may still delay making a decision. In these situations, the perceived cost of not making a decision  is viewed as being lower than that of making an immediate decision ."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Another critical piece of your data story may be to create a sense of ur gency around solving the problem you’ve identified or seizing the opportunity before a window closes. Frequently , if you can quantify the cost of not making a decision from a daily or weekly perspective, it can help motivate your audience to act on the insights you’ve shared with them. For example, after sharing a recommendation on how the ecommerce team could improve product sales, you could emphasize how delaying the proposed changes costs the company $2 million each week in lost potential revenue. Once you attach monetary figures to the cost of delaying a decision, your audience will better appreciate why a decision must be made in a timely fashion."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Finally , if you are presenting your data story directly to your audience, you need to leave suf ficient time for questions and discussion. It can be a critical step in gaining buy-in and alignment from a group of stakeholders with diverse opinions. At one presentation I attended, a manager laid out an impressive data story to a group of executives. Just as he was finishing his presentation, I noticed the executives had already started closing their laptops to head to their next meeting. A wave of panic swept over the manager ’s face as he realized he hadn’ t given his audience an opportunity to discuss the insights and agree on a course of action. A few weeks later , he was able to reschedule another meeting so they could discuss and decide on next steps, but he lost some momentum in the process."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"If you’ve crafted a compelling data story , anticipate that it will generate a healthy amount of questions and discussion. Ensure you leave adequate time at the end of your data story (or during) for two-way communication to occur—it may end up being essential to persuading your audience to act on your insights. What If Y ou Don’t Have All the Answers? In some situations, you may have discovered a great Aha Moment, but you may find yourself struggling to develop meaningful recommendations. This can be due to not having the required authority , expertise, or domain knowledge to propose legitimate solutions."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Y ou definitely don’ t want to undermine your credibility by suggesting impractical or untenable options just so your narrative conforms with the Data Storytelling Arc. In some scenarios, it may be more expedient to share the story up to the Aha Moment and then leverage the collective know-how and resources of the audience to determine the best course of action. The narrative structure can set the stage for collaborative problem solving and ensure the group clearly understands the nature of the situation, its level of ur gency , and desired outcomes. While you may not always have all of the answers at your disposal, you can still spearhead the search for solutions and enlist the help of a capable, invested audience."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"When They Want Just the Facts I was a kind of hyper -intense person in my twenties and very impatient. —Bill Gates, Microsoft founder and philanthropist When I’ve shared the Data Storytelling Arc at presentations and workshops, I’m often asked how data storytellers should handle impatient executives who “just want the facts.” These time-challenged individuals are unlikely to wait patiently for you to build up to your Aha Moment. Y ou may have no more than 10–15 minutes (sometimes less) to get your main point across before they lose interest and shift their attention to another pressing topic. In these situations, the generally accepted practice is to provide an executive summary in which you review the most important information at the outset. However , as I noted in Chapter 4 , this approach negates many of the benefits you would gain from having a narrative structure."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"With this type of audience, you can’ t just launch into your data story . Even when you know they’ll care about your findings, they’re not conditioned to receive information in a story format. T o accommodate an impatient executive, you’ll need to create a data trailer  for your data story (see Figure 6.13). Similar to movie trailers that are designed to promote a film and draw in an audience, your data trailer is designed to pique the inter est of your audience and gain their permission  to tell the entire story . While a movie trailer tries not to ruin the story by giving away any spoilers, the data trailer includes a brief Setting and Hook with a major spoiler—the Aha Moment. In situations where an impatient boss or executive must be convinced of the payof f for listening to a data story , you reveal why your insight is worth 20 minutes of attention. After hearing the data trailer , the executive has the option to say “tell me more” or indicate they’re not interested in learning more. A data trailer isn’ t an alternative to having a complete data story—it’ s simply a tool for gaining an executive’ s buy-in and inviting them to explore the rest of your data story . Figur e 6.13 The Data Trailer is designed to pique interest from the impatient execu tive and gain her permission to tell your data story . If you gain permission, you’ve alread y set up your data story , so you can dive immediately into the Rising Insights. Data storytelling is still a relatively new approach for data communication. Up until now , most executives have been exposed to mind-numbing data dumps on a repeated basis over the years. Their insistence for “just the facts” may just be a coping mechanism to avoid being overloaded and inundated with too much noise. If you see a potential opening, I’d encourage you to test a simple data story on this type of executive—even if it means starting with the modified data trailer approach. Despite their hardened exterior , everyone loves a good story—it’ s in their DNA. Once they’ve experienced what ef fective data communication feels like, don’ t be surprised when they advocate for data stories to be shared throughout your organization. Uncovering the Heroes in Your Data Story I think the best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event, which is to say character -driven. —Stephen King, author Characters are an essential element of stories. What would Pride and Prejudice  be like without Elizabeth Bennet, or the Harry Potter  series without Lord V oldemort? While the plot of the story is important, it’ s the characters—the protagonist and antagonist—who breathe life into the tale and make it truly interesting. As we turn to our raw data, it can seem cold, distant, and impersonal."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Most likely the heroes of your data story are standing in front of you; you just need to adjust your frame of reference to see them. Confusion about Who Is the “Her o” of a Data Story From time to time, I’ve heard people say the “audience is the hero of a data story .” I believe this viewpoint can lead to confusion and misdirect the focus of your data story . Its original intent was probably to emphasize making the story as relatable as possible to the audience. I believe this objective can be achieved without necessarily casting the audience as the lead role in your data story . To be honest, most people don’ t want to be the focus of attention—they don’t want a light shined on their accomplishments or (especially) their failures. Imagine how uncomfortable it would be to sit through a film or play depicting your life story . Between the painful inaccuracies and equally painful truths, you’d want to flee for the exit."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"While your audience most likely won’ t be the main characters in your data story , I believe they can still be heroes in a dif ferent but critical way.

Y our data story can prepare the audience to be real heroes as they embrace and apply your insights to drive value within an or ganization. In my career in marketing analytics, I found it highly ef fective to highlight people—not just numbers—in my data stories. I found marketing audiences enjoyed getting deeper insights into their customers and prospects, so featuring them as characters in my presentations was an ef fective way of gaining their interest, attention, and buy-in. The following five-step process (see Figure 6.14 ) reveals how you can add heroes to your next data story: 1. Determine wher e your insights intersect with people. In some cases, it may be easy to identify the group of people your analysis touches. In these cases, the challenge is how broad or narrow your focus should be."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Depending on what’ s relevant or important to your data story , you can profile dif ferent aspects—such as their gender , ethnicity , location, income level, interests, and so on. Sometimes, you may include details that may not be essential to your story but are helpful in establishing an interesting and memorable character . 3. Give your her o an identity . Whether or not you’re a fan of stock photography , a useful tactic in creating your hero is to show a representative picture of who they are."

Inserting relatable and recognizable characters into your data story will help humanize your narrative and enable your audience to see your insights from a people-centered perspective. While it may not always be possible or easy with every dataset, any opportunity to show how your insights impact human beings should be pursued, especially when your audience cares about those individuals. By putting a human face on your numbers, you make the data much more approachable and engaging for your audience. How Conflict Amplifies the Impact of Your Data Narrative Conflict is to story what sound is to music. —Robert McKee, screenwriting expert and author In narrative, conflict is the challenge or problem the story’ s main characters must overcome to achieve their goal."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"Fortunately , data stories often have conflict at their core, as they are primarily centered on solving problems or seizing untapped opportunities. The source of conflict can be internal— your company , department, or team isn’t measuring up to its past performance, expectations, or a specific goal or tar get. The source could be external— your group is underperforming when benchmarked against a peer group, a competitor , or the overall industry . Even though conflict will be an inherent part of your story , like a writer or director , you still need to decide how you’re going to employ it strategically within your data narrative."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Novelist W illiam Landay noted, “Good stories are driven by conflict, tension, and high stakes.” In certain situations, and with an audience you know well, these techniques can make your data story more compelling. However , you’ll want to be careful to use them tactfully and judiciously . As you invite the audience to participate in the evaluation of the data, you need to be amply prepared for unexpected feedback and sidetracking observations. In addition, the goal isn’ t to embarrass anyone in your audience when they guess wrong or frustrate people with a slower interactive approach when they’re anxious and ready to learn more."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"If they are employed wisely by the data storyteller , conflict and tension can be helpful at keeping your audience engaged and focused on your message. Make Your Ideas More Digestible with Analogies Analogies, it is true, decide nothing, but they can make one feel more at home. —Sigmund Freud, neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Whenever your data narrative deals with a new or complex subject, there’ s another narrative tool that can be helpful— analogies . An analogy is a comparison of a complex  or unfamiliar  subject matter to another that is simpler  or more familiar . As an example, in Chapter 5 , when I introduced the concept of working memory , I compared the human brain to a computer , based on its input, processing, and memory components."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"As American attorney Dudley Field Malone recognized, “One good analogy is worth three hours of discussion.” In data storytelling, analogies can also be used to communicate key concepts or insights in a manner that is easier and faster for an audience to follow and absorb. They can be used at any stage in your data story if they can help sharpen or quicken the audience’ s understanding of your insights. Instead of having to invest significant time explaining new information to others, you can expedite the knowledge transfer  process by tying of f key ideas with relatable analogies. For example, you could compare the current challenges in a manufacturer ’s supply chain to a triathlon. When a triathlete struggles at one of her transitions (T1: swim-to-bike), the problems can cascade throughout the race like they do with supply chain issues."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"When you’re presenting your data story , they can also create opportunities to use visual imagery and add emotional power to your narrative. Even the mental imagery of a well-chosen analogy can make your data story more potent. For example, your findings could be about a new competitor that has recently emer ged in your industry and is taking away key customers. Alternatively , your insights could be about a broken internal process that is inhibiting your sales growth. Either of these examples can be positioned as a villain that must be confronted and defeated."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Cultural anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson said, “The human species thinks in metaphors and learns through stories.” Good analogies can complement your insights by facilitating learning and injecting more narrative into your data story . However , if you’re not careful, bad analogies can just as easily confuse your audience and weaken your overall story . In order to verify whether you have a solid analogy , you’ll want to consider the following attributes: 1. Is it r elatable?"
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"An analogy can be used to clarify a minor aspect of your findings or to help underscore a major theme within your data story .

If you don’ t have sound data, it is dif ficult to find meaningful insights. When you uncover an insight, you may assume you already have the right data for your data story . As a result, you end up repurposing the original chart you created in your exploratory analysis without questioning if a dif ferent view of the data might paint an even more vivid picture for the audience. For example, we often work with total values (counts or sums), but there may be a more meaningful way of expressing the same insight using dif ferent data (see Figure 7.8 ). Sometimes, a simple adjustment to the underlying data can make a good chart a great one."

Using this framework, you can step back from the various data visualization options and more objectively evaluate how they will communicate your data. For example, if you examine the graphical methods that comprise a pie chart, you’ll discover they require a combination of the angle  and area perceptual tasks, which reside in the middle of the perceptual task ranking. On closer examination, you notice that both pie and donut charts are also encoded with position  along their circumferences (circular scales) because they resemble something we observe on a regular basis—a clock or watch face."

A good step after you’ve visualized your data is to determine which data elements are required to make your point. Basically , if any of the visualized information isn’ t directly tied to your message or doesn’ t provide essential context, it can be removed.

Depending on how you’re delivering your data story , the scenes can take dif ferent forms (see Figure 8.6 ). The most common form of a scene is a presentation slide or a static image. However , scenes can be delivered sequentially in a video or laid out as sections in a report or infographic.

Assuming the data foundation of your data story is sound— minimal bias, acceptable data quality , thorough analysis, and so on—your visuals must also establish credibility with the audience. A simple oversight in your visuals can undo hours of analysis work and close a window of opportunity that may never re-open. For example, misspellings, typos, and bad grammar can convey carelessness to your audience, which may cause them to question how detail-oriented you were in the analysis phase. Human errors such as having parts of a whole chart not add up to 100% or even mislabeling an axis can derail your message."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Make sure you take time to review and proofread all of the scenes of your data story before sharing it. In addition, consider having someone else review your charts to avoid simple mistakes that could hurt your story . While attention to detail will always be important, you also need to be aware of how data can be visually manipulated in charts— and not inadvertently mimic those tactics . Even when your intent isn’ t to distort the data, you must be mindful of how certain visualization practices may be perceived as “lying with statistics.” Table 8.6  illustrates practices you should try to avoid, as they may be perceived as being deceptive."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"However , once you’ve stated the source, it doesn’ t need to be highlighted in every subsequent chart unless the source changes or you anticipate individual visuals being shared independently from the rest of the data story . You don’ t want to give your audience any reason to doubt your numbers or insights. It’ s important to be aware of how people might question the veracity of your data due to how you visualize it and what you communicate (or ignore). T o build credibility with the audience, you must ensure they understand your intent is to inform and enlighten, not deceive."

It continues with organizing and structuring the insights into a meaningful and compelling narrative. In the final step of this process, you visualize your insights in a clear and concise manner so the information is easy for your audience to follow and understand. The seven principles shared in this and the previous chapter can guide your visual storytelling, transforming your key findings into a powerful series of visual scenes."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Second, you need to determine how you’re going to deliver the data story to your audience—directly or indirectly . The delivery method will influence your story’ s visual design. For example, if you’re not telling your story in person, more explanation or annotations will be required for each scene. The three-step process in Table 8.7  can help you plan and design the scenes of your data story . Table 8.7  Three-step Pr ocess to Plan and Design Y our Data Story Sketch. Before you start creating any charts in an analytics tool, you might find it helpful to sketch a mock-up for each story point, especially if your story has multiple scenes. You can use a notepad, sticky notes, or a whiteboard to create a rough vision for how you’re going to visualize the information. Because you’re only investing a small amount of time to create each sketch, you’re freed up to iterate quickly until you identify the best visual approach for each chart."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"The act of sketching your entire data story also gives you an opportunity to step back and ensure that your visuals are not too repetitive and that you have the right flow . You can also walk a colleague through your story to gather feedback and make modifications before you spend any time building charts. Design. Once you’re happy with the rough visual outline of your data story , you can start designing the data visualizations. At this stage, you’re focused on making sure the charts are aligned to your story points and convey the information in an ef fective manner . As you work with the actual data, you may discover you need to modify your charts from what you planned in the sketch phase. It’ s important to be flexible and defer to whatever approach will best communicate your insights."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"After you’ve created the initial charts for your data story , you should evaluate how well each one supports your storyline. Y ou may find small edits to your charts can dramatically enhance their overall effectiveness. For example, you may add direct labels to make a chart easier to read or realign the colors used in a chart to be more consistent. These kinds of simple but important refinements can add polish to your final scenes and help them resonate with your audience."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"However , data storytelling is an active  experience in which you invite the audience to join you on a guided tour through your insights. A data story enables the audience to participate in a simplified, focused discovery process— examining the charts and comparing the numbers for themselves. The easier you make the visuals to follow and process, the more likely your audience will understand, retain, and agree with your main points. The late Hans Rosling compared data storytelling to music when he said, Most of us need to listen to the music to understand how beautiful it is. But often that’ s how we present statistics: W e just show the notes; we don’t play the music. (Reynolds 2007) Effective visual storytelling is about getting your audience to hear how wonderful your music sounds—not just read the notes. Only when the signal is strong and clear will they be able to fully appreciate the beauty of your numbers. If you’ve done a good job with your visual storytelling, you’ll have an attentive audience that is excited to begin tackling the problems or opportunities you’ve identified."

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"The primary reason why you invest time in building a data story is to give your insight a better chance at fulfilling its potential. When you satisfy your three objectives as a data storyteller , you end up communicating more than just facts and figures. Y our data stories have the power to change what people think and how they act. As a data storyteller , you are not only guiding an audience through the data to key insights but seeking to inspir e change . Once you’re practiced in the art of data storytelling, your impact will only be limited by the magnitude of your insights. Through the chapters of this book, we’ve explored the importance of storytelling, what a data story is, and what its dif ferent components are. After closely examining each of the data storytelling pillars—data, narrative, and visuals—you’re ready to see how they can be combined to create compelling data stories. In this final chapter , I’ll share examples of different data stories, starting with one shared by the late, great data storyteller Hans Rosling. Learning from a Master Data Storyteller The world cannot be understood without numbers. But the world cannot be understood with numbers alone. —Hans Rosling, physician, professor , and statistician In 2010, the British TV channel BBC Four produced a one-hour documentary with Hans Rosling called The Joy of Stats . Within this program, there’ s a short segment known as “200 Countries, 200 Y ears, 4 Minutes” in which Rosling reveals how the health and wealth of countries have evolved over the last 200 years (Gapminder 2019). However , rather than having him present his insights using a standard projector , they simulate an interactive bubble chart that hovers in augmented reality in front of the master data storyteller . In this unique setting, Hans Rosling’ s genius and passion leave us spellbound as he demonstrates how data can be made to sing. From this short segment, we have an opportunity to study the various storytelling techniques Rosling employed to craft and deliver his data story . In a play-by-play manner , I’ll break down the dif ferent tactics he used to develop his narrative and engage his audience. Before you read my analysis of Rosling’ s data story , I highly recommend watching his four -minute video to see this insightful Swedish storyteller in action (http://bit.ly/200countries200years ). Through the lens of the concepts within this book, you’ll better understand what made Rosling such an effective and engaging data storyteller . 0:34—Key T actics: Labeling, Annotation, and Axis Scaling At the beginning of his story , Rosling adds labels to the axes (lifespan, income) and clarifies what the two main quadrants are (lower -left: poor and sick; upper -right: rich and healthy) using annotation (see Figure 9.1 ). You’ll notice his y-axis didn’ t begin at zero years (approximately 20 years to 75 years), and the x-axis has a logarithmic scale ($400 to $40,000). As a general rule, starting axes at zero and using a linear scale is preferred. However , in order to maximize the space and spread the data points apart, you might need to make similar adjustments to enhance a scene in your data story ."

He ends his data story by underlining how aid, trade, green technology , and peace can help all countries achieve better living standards.

Hans Rosling holds our hands as he guides us through the data, giving us a new appreciation of the global health and wealth trends that have occurred over the past 200 years. Throughout the process, we notice what he wants us to see, and he provides timely , relevant context as the patterns shift. As you contemplate your own data, you may be thinking to yourself, “My [fill the blank] data isn’ t as cool or impactful as Rosling’ s data."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"A special ef fect without a story is a pretty boring thing.” From this example, we learn how integral both the storyteller and narrative are to the overall data story . Rosling’ s insights would have been bland if he hadn’ t taken the time to craft a powerful narrative around them. While we may not be able to replicate his passion, witty sense of humor , or augmented reality graphs, we can apply many of the same techniques that Rosling used to enrich our own data stories.

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"The elegance and significance of Rosling’ s storytelling helped Baron “see the world in a dif ferent way .” When his television production company approached Rosling about The Joy of Stats  project, Baron knew the showcase of the entire one-hour program would be capturing the ener getic Swede sharing one of his inspiring data stories. However , Baron believed the audience’ s comprehension would be diminished if the video had to cut back and forth between the storyteller and the graph. His team decided they would have Rosling conjure up the data out of thin air and have it hover in front of him in augmented reality . Similar to the virtual displays used in the T om Cruise movie Minority Report (2002), this approach would keep Rosling and his animated bubble chart in the same frame. “The idea was that by putting Rosling in the graph,” says Baron, “he completely owns it and the story it tells.” When the W ingspan team pitched the idea to Rosling, the professor was initially skeptical about whether it would work."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"He hadn’ t always been satisfied with past attempts at filming his data storytelling and never wanted infographics to be purely for show . However , after showing him a brief demo of how the virtual chart might work, they were able to convince him to take a leap of faith with them. Even though the data story segment was only four minutes long, it consumed 25–30% of the production time for the 60-minute show . During many long days of scripting and storyboarding, Baron witnessed how Rosling paid meticulous attention to every detail and was determined to develop a script that would be clear and compelling for the viewers. Director Dan Hillman noted, “I loved the technical precision which he applied to finding the best way to tell a story , tell a joke, show a number , and make a point.” For the filming location, they decided it should be in a real location with some depth rather than a bland TV studio. This is why you see Rosling entering a warehouse building at the beginning of the video."

My goal was to provide you with enough direction and structure to help you transform your facts and figures into communications that resonate with your audiences. However , not all of your data stories are going to neatly align with every concept and framework in this book. Y ou’re going to need to use your judgment on what will work best in each unique situation. Likewise, the same data story may need to be modified to accommodate dif ferent circumstances or situations. For example, being able to present your story in person will change its shape and format. If you deliver your story to diverse groups of people, you may need to alter its design and emphasis to match each unique audience. If you have a short amount of time to share your insights, you’ll compose your data story dif ferently than if you have a longer window of time. Since each new scenario will be unique, you’ll need to be flexible and adaptive with your data storytelling. The concepts and principles in this book are meant to guide your appr oach, not r estrict it . When you need to deviate from a best practice, do so in an informed, calculated manner , knowing what you’re sacrificing to achieve a specific aim with your storytelling. One of the most ef fective ways of learning new techniques is to see them in action."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"After you’ve read the entire data story , I’ll review some of the key design decisions I made as I was building it. T o make it easier to review later , I’ve divided the story up into three main sections, or acts. As you read the following data story , do your own evaluation of the interplay of dif ferent elements—data, narrative, and visuals. Even when you use good practices in your data storytelling, there is usually more than one way of telling each data story , and each storyteller will have his or her own unique style and preferences. Act I: The Setting Welsh industrialist and social reformer Robert Owen (1771–1858) stated, “To train and educate the rising generation will at all times be the first object of society , to which every other will be subordinate.” Education is essential to a country’ s development and growth. Much of the United States’ s success as a nation can be traced back to having one of the best education systems in the world. However , over the past few decades, concerns have risen that the United States’ s educational advantage may be eroding."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"NCLB Data Story: Behind the Scenes This US education data story used a variety of data from dif ferent sources, as well as an assortment of data visualizations to convey its key messages. It also followed the data storytelling arc across the three main sections. T o give you a deeper understanding and appreciation of how this data story was formed, I’ll share some of the key design decisions that occurred in each section. Act I Review The first section introduces the topic and focus of the data story . After providing a brief background on the US education system in the Setting stage, I used a visual Hook—the United States’ s mediocre PISA scores in 2000—to draw the audience into the story . Here are some of the tactics I employed in this section (see Figure 9.16 ): Starting point. Rather than beginning my data story with a comprehensive overview of education trends in the United States, I jumped right into an indicator of the problems facing the nation—its subpar ranking among countries in terms of its international PISA scores. Quotes. To set the stage and provide context for my data story , I employed a couple of quotes. In some cases, an astute quote can be just as ef fective as a good visualization at grabbing people’ s attention. Jitter plot. For the PISA scores, I used a jitter plot (see Figure 9.9 ) to spread out the results of the other OECD countries."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"I could then reuse these icons throughout the rest of the data story to reinforce which subjects I was focusing on. I decided to use star dots to highlight the US scores in the chart and add a little patriotic flair to the visual. Figur e 9.16  In Act I, I used a jitter plot and icons as key visual storytelling tactics. Act II Review The next section introduced the NCLB Act and evaluated whether it was able to reverse the declining educational performance in the United States."

Diverging column chart. For the proficiency-level data, a diver ging column chart (see Figure 9.10 ) is ef fective at displaying a rating scale because the negative and positive can be situated on either side of a common baseline. This chart was inspired by a similar chart created by Pew Research (Desilver 2017)."

Highlight colors. Rather than labeling individual countries in Figure 9.12, I only highlighted the US and OECD average scores. I could have focused on just these two lines, but having other country results in the background as grayscale provides useful context."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Here are some of the final tactics used to complete the data story (see Figure 9.18 ): Chart versus statistic. Figure 9.6  shows the United State is the fifth- worst OECD country for child poverty . I could have just shared this single statistic (29.4%), but I felt as though displaying the data for all the OECD countries added more weight and context. In other scenarios, you may elect to share a single figure, and it can be impactful without necessarily having to graph it."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"As you reviewed this NCLB data story , you may not have realized how much thought and preparation went into the selection of the data, formation of the narrative, and design of the visuals. Aside from it being a useful example, there was also a secondary purpose in sharing this particular story . Even though NCLB introduced unparalleled levels of data into the US education system, it had a negligible impact on student performance. A former school principal Simon Rodber g noted, “Better instruction won’ t come from more detailed information, but from changing what people do . . . convincing teachers of the need to change and focusing where they need to change” (Rodber g 2019)."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"Everyday Data Stories Come in All Shapes, Sizes, and Flavors “Good story” means something worth telling that the world wants to hear. Finding this is your lonely task. . . . Y our goal must be a good story well told. —Robert McKee, screenwriting expert and author Many successful data stories aren’ t prepared by well-known data journalists or data visualization experts. Y ou won’ t find them posted to popular media sites or shared at prominent conferences. Their authors also don’ t receive any industry accolades or recognition. However , these data stories can have a tremendous impact on the teams, departments, and companies where they’re shared. I’d like to turn the spotlight on a couple of these everyday examples of data storytelling. Based on a T rue Story #1: An Editor Must Retain a Skilled W riter At a major media company , Sarah, a senior editor , cringed when she found out that one of her young, up-and-coming writers with a good social media following had just received a job of fer from a competitor . After joining the company less than two years earlier , the junior writer would be receiving a significant pay increase—from $30,000 to $60,000. Sarah knew that if she lost this rising star , her team would struggle to hit its tar gets the rest of the year."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Rather than building an elaborate data story , Sarah sent a simple email to Jim, the lead editor , in the format of a data trailer (see Figure 9.19 ). Figur e 9.19  Sarah emailed her boss, Jim, a modified data trailer to save one of her high-performing team members, W endy . Rather than providing her busy manager with all of the data from their analysis of W endy’ s contributions, Sarah limited her data story to just a simple data trailer: Setting  (two-year tenure, 30,000 social followers), Hook ($60,000 job of fer), and Aha Moment ($1.5 million in revenue). In this case, the data trailer included the proposed Solution ($65,000 counterof fer), as it was an ur gent request that needed attention. If Jim wanted to dive deeper into the revenue calculations, Sarah could prepare a more robust data story for him. In this case, the $1.5 million in incremental ad revenue made the counterof fer decision a no-brainer for Jim, and he quickly approved Sarah’ s recommendation. Five years later , Wendy still works at the same media company and probably has no idea just how valuable she is to her employer . Wendy’ s version of Sarah’ s data story could have concluded with a dif ferent recommendation—for get $65,000, try $125,000. As this example illustrates, every data story doesn’ t need to be a major production. A simple chart with a concise narrative may be all that is required to drive a quick decision and tar geted action. In this case, the visual helped emphasize Sarah’ s Aha Moment to her boss. While you may not always need a chart in shorter communications, a simple visual may be just the tipping point you need to influence a key decision like this one."

Setting and Hook: Almost a Third of Customer Accounts Weren’t Profitable: Kevin’ s first goal was to educate the leadership team on its current customer portfolio in terms of both revenue and profitability . The manufacturer generated approximately $75 million in profits from $720 million in annual revenues.

B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"Data storytelling not only enabled the analytics manager to gain buy-in from his leadership team, but it also informed how the sales team negotiated better pricing with their negative-mar gin customers. These two real-world data stories illustrate how ef fective data storytelling can transform the fortunes of a team or an entire or ganization. Neither example required an excessive amount of data or visuals to tell their stories. If you take and apply the concepts and principles in this book, you’ll be positioned to achieve similar success with your own “everyday” data stories —no matter what shape, size, or flavor they come in. Data Storyteller: A Guide and a Change Agent No one ever made a decision because of a number . They need a story . —Daniel Kahneman, psychologist, behavioral economist, and author Data storytelling is transformative. Many people don’ t realize that when they share insights, they’re not just imparting information to other people. The natural consequence of sharing an insight is change. Stop doing that, and do mor e of this."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"So, as a data storyteller , you’re not only guiding the audience through the data, you’re also acting as a change agent . Rather than just pointing out possible enhancements, you’re helping your audience fully understand the ur gency of the changes and giving them the confidence to move forward. In an age of rapid digital transformation, or ganizations are going to need more data-savvy change agents than ever before. People who can find insights and turn them into improvements and innovations will be highly valued in the marketplace."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data storytelling,"The power of data storytelling can’ t be limited to just a handful of data professionals. Since data is no longer the limited domain of certain functional areas such as IT , finance, or accounting, it’ s now critical that employees in all departments from Human Resources to Sales know how to communicate with data ef fectively . Every or ganization —start-up, enterprise, nonprofit, or government agency—needs to invite more of its people to engage in data conversations. The telling and sharing of data stories can serve as a much-needed catalyst in developing a stronger , more diverse data culture. In the journey to becoming a data-driven change agent, each individual must progress through the following three stages (see Figure 9.22 ): 1. Data literacy . First, as I mentioned in Chapter 1 , you need to gain a foundation in basic numeracy skills such as being able to process and interpret a standard data table or chart."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"A potentially good data story will quickly unravel if it’ s based on a poor or erroneous interpretation of the numbers. Fortunately , data literacy skills can be developed through training and hands-on experience. 2. Data curiosity . The next important step is to develop the desire and capacity to be curious, ask questions of the data, and seek to expand your knowledge."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data stories,"The magnitude and value of the insights you discover will dictate whether they deserve to be crafted into data stories so they can be fully actualized. 3. Data storytelling. The last step is to learn how to ef fectively communicate your insights so they can be clearly understood by others. No transformation will occur if your message is unclear , overwhelming, or convoluted. Y our data communications also must be persuasive and memorable if they’re going to stick with your audiences."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"If you’ve done a good job preparing and telling your data story , the audience will embrace your insights as their own and be motivated to act on them. Figur e 9.22 To become a data-driven change agent, you need to be sufficiently data literate so you can understand and interpret the data correctly . Next, you need to be curious and free to explore the data to find meaningful insights. Last, you need to acquire data storytelling skills so you can communicate your insights in an ef fective manner . If you’re reading this book, you are most likely already data literate and somewhat curious about data. At this moment, you’re probably interested in augmenting your existing data storytelling skills. However , if you’d like to start telling data stories but don’ t feel you have a good grasp of the underlying data, you must first spend time strengthening your numeracy skills. Because data is the foundation, a weak insight will always compromise the integrity of a data story , no matter how well it is structured or visualized. If you have the necessary data literacy skills but lack curiosity , I’d recommend evaluating what internal or external factors may be holding you back. The growing amount of available information is begging to be explored by an inquiring mind that isn’ t stuck in neutral. American folklorist Jack Zipes observed, “The role of the storyteller is to awaken the storyteller in others.” Due to the circular nature of this process (see Figure 9.22 ), an interesting relationship is for ged between the data storyteller and audience."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"Before you build a data story , you need to be aware of how data literate your audience is and tailor your content to their level. As an audience is repeatedly exposed to new insights, the data literacy level of the participants will be enhanced over time. Just like regular reading can improve someone’ s literacy skills, consuming data stories on a continual basis will boost their data-literacy abilities. Furthermore, data stories may spark interest among the audience members to explore the data for themselves and build data stories based on their own findings. Gradually , more change agents will be created through the act of data storytelling, and their voices will be added to an increasingly vibrant exchange of data conversations. Your mission as a data storyteller is to ensure each meaningful insight that crosses your path receives a fair shot at having its story heard. Y ou may already have several insights in mind that are begging to have their tales told. Y our skill in telling a compelling data story may be the dif ference between a problem being resolved or overlooked, an opportunity being seized or missed, or a risk being mitigated or exacerbated. Poet Dr . Maya Angelou said, “If you want what you’re saying heard, then take your time and say it so that the listener will actually hear it.” W ith data, you not only want your message heard—you want the audience to see and understand the insights as clearly as you do. If you’ve uncovered what appears to be a significant insight (and it falls in the Story Zone from Chapter 4 ), you must invest the time and ef fort to craft a data story that is commensurate with its weight and importance. If you produce anything less, you do a disservice to the insight and put it at risk of being discounted or ignored. Even though the way in which we tell stories has evolved significantly over the centuries, stories still possess an almost mystical power over us. They still play an integral role in how we process and store information."
B4,"Effective data storytelling: how to drive change with data, narrative and visuals",1,0,data story,"From Florence Nightingale to Hans Rosling, dif ferent data storytellers have been able to successfully combine data visualizations with narrative to inspire and drive positive change. Based on the data storytelling principles I’ve shared in this book, you should be better prepared to follow a similar path with your own data discoveries. The Hopi Indian tribe is attributed with the saying “Those who tell the stories rule the world.” T oday , with our increasing reliance on data, the people who tell data stories ef fectively will be the ones who influence and rule our digital world. But to paraphrase one of my favorite storytellers of all time, the late comic book icon Stan Lee, “with great power comes great responsibility .” While data storytelling can rescue insights that would otherwise be lost in a sea of data, it can also be used to distort truth and mislead people. As truth-seeking data storytellers, our responsibility is to ensure our data stories lead to enlightenment, not deception. The art of data storytelling is still at a formative stage in its development, and it is our shared duty to ensure this digital craft is held to a high standard and conducted with integrity . No matter how sound your facts are, how compelling your narrative is, or how stunning your visuals are, data storytelling will be challenging at times. Because new insights represent change, you’re going to be confronting the status quo, accepted traditions, common practices, and institutional norms on an ongoing basis. While data storytelling can strengthen the delivery of your key points, it doesn’ t guarantee dif ficult decisions will be easier for your audience to make. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . said, “Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability , but comes through continuous struggle.” Y our unrelenting efforts to provide the numbers with a clear , compelling voice will make a demonstrable dif ference—whether it’ s to your team, or ganization, community , or cause. As this is a relatively new field within the ancient discipline of storytelling, we’ll continue to see new innovations and approaches in data storytelling as our capabilities and creativity evolve. Just as I’ve shared some of the key learnings from my journeys in data storytelling, I look forward to hearing of your triumphs and trials in crafting stories from data. Regardless, may your data stories end happily ever after by inspiring audiences to act and embrace change. Nuf f said! (Thanks, Stan.)

This includes (but is certainly not lim- ited to): analysts sharing the results of their work, students visualizing  thesis data, managers needing to communicate in a data‐driven way,  philanthropists proving their impact, and leaders informing their  board. I believe that anyone can improve their ability to communi- cate effectively with data. This is an intimidating space for many, but  it does not need to be."

Google People  Analytics is cutting edge, helping to forge a path that many other  10 introduction companies have started to follow. Being involved in building and  growing this team was an incredible experience. Storytelling with data on what makes a great  manager via Project Oxygen One particular project that has been highlighted in  the public sphere is the Project Oxygen research at  Google on what makes a great manager. This work has been  described in the New York Times  and is the basis of a pop - ular Harvard Business Review  case study. One challenge  faced was communicating the findings to various audiences,  from engineers who were sometimes skeptical on meth - odology and wanted to dig into the details, to managers  wanting to understand the big‐picture findings and how to  put them to use. My involvement in the project was on the  communication piece, helping to determine how to best  show sometimes very complicated stuff in a way that would  appease the engineers and their desire for detail while still  being understandable and straightforward for managers and  various levels of leadership."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"The lessons in the book are organized chronologically in the same  way that I think about the storytelling with data process. Because of  this and because later chapters do build on and in some cases refer  back to earlier content, I recommend reading from beginning to  end. After you’ve done this, you’ll likely find yourself referring back  to specific points of interest or examples that are relevant to the cur - rent data visualization challenges you face. 14 introduction To give you a more specific idea of the path we’ll take, chapter sum- maries can be found below. Chapter 1: the importance of context Before you start down the path of data visualization, there are a  couple of questions that you should be able to concisely answer:  Who is your audience?"
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"In this comprehensive chapter, we follow  the storytelling with data process from start to finish using a single  real‐world example. We understand the context, choose an appro- priate visual display, identify and eliminate clutter, draw attention  to where we want our audience to focus, think like a designer, and  tell a story. Together, these lessons and resulting visuals and narra- tive illustrate how we can move from simply showing data to telling  a story with data. How this book is organized  17 Chapter 9: case studies The penultimate chapter explores specific strategies for tackling  common challenges faced in communicating with data through a  number of case studies."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,These  are the same questions we’ve discussed when it comes to  understanding the context for storytelling with data. Who is  your audience? What do you need them to know or do? It is  only after the answers to these questions can be succinctly  articulated that an effective method of display that will best  aid the message can be chosen.
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"You now know the second lesson of storytelling with data: how to  choose an appropriate visual display .  71chapter three clutter is your enemy! Picture a blank page or a blank screen: every single element you  add to that page or screen takes up cognitive load on the part of  your audience—in other words, takes them brain power to process. Therefore, we want to take a discerning look at the visual elements  that we allow into our communications. In general, identify anything  that isn’t adding informative value—or isn’t adding enough  informa- tive value to make up for its presence—and remove those things."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"Now you’re ready for the final storytelling with data lesson: tell a  story .  165chapter seven lessons in storytelling  In my workshops, the lesson on storytelling often begins with a  thought exercise. I ask participants to close their eyes and recall  the story of Red Riding Hood , considering specifically the plot, the  twists, and the ending. This exercise sometimes generates some  laughs; people wonder about its relevance or gamely confuse it with  Three Little Pigs. But I find that the majority of participants (typically  around 80–90% based on a show of hands) are able to remember  the high‐level story—often a modified version of Grimms’ maca - bre original."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"Next, let’s look at an example of the entire storytelling with data pro- cess, from start to finish.  187chapter eight pulling it all together  Up to this point, we’ve focused on individual lessons that, together,  set you up for success when it comes to effectively visualizing and  communicating with data. To refresh your memory, we’ve covered  the following lessons: 1. Understand the context (Chapter 1) 2. Choose an appropriate display (Chapter 2) 3."

In this penultimate chapter, we  explore strategies for tackling common challenges faced when com - municating with data through a number of case studies. Specifically, we’ll discuss: •	Color considerations with a dark background •	Leveraging animation in the visuals you present •	Establishing logic in order •	Strategies for avoiding the spaghetti graph •	Alternatives to pie charts Within each of these case studies, I’ll apply the various lessons we’ve  covered when it comes to communicating effectively with data, but  will limit my discussion mainly to the specific challenge at hand. 208 case studies  CASE STUDY 1: Color considerations with a dark  background When it comes to communicating data, I don’t typically recommend  anything other than a white background. Let’s take a look at what  a simple graph looks like on a white, blue, and black background."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"In this final chapter, we’ll discuss some tips on where to go from  here and strategies for upskilling storytelling with data competency  in your team and organization. Finally, we will end with a recap of  242 final thoughts  the main lessons we’ve covered and send you off eager and ready  to tell stories with data. Where to go from here Reading about effective storytelling with data is one thing. But how  do you translate what we’ve learned to practical application? The sim - ple way to get good at this is to do it : practice, practice, and practice  some more. Look for opportunities in your work to apply the lessons  we’ve learned."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,Consider also when you can leverage the entire  storytelling with data process that we’ve covered from start to finish. Now I want to overhaul our entire monthly report! You likely see graphs differently than you did at the onset  of our journey together. Rethinking the way you visual- ize data is a great thing.
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"Insert a few slides or a cover note up  front and use this to pull out the interesting stories, leverag- ing the storytelling with data lessons we’ve covered. This way  you can more easily focus your audience on the important  stories and resulting actions. For some specific, concrete steps on where to go from here, I’ll out- line five final tips: learn your tools well, iterate and seek feedback,  allow ample time for this part of the process, seek inspiration from    Where to go from here  243 others, and—last but not least—have some fun while you’re at it! Let’s discuss each of these."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"Tip #2: iterate and seek feedback I’ve presented the storytelling with data process as a linear path. That’s not often the case in reality. Rather, it takes iterating to get  from early ideas to a final solution. When the best course for visual- izing certain data is unclear, start with a blank piece of paper."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"Tip #3: devote time to storytelling with data Everything we’ve discussed throughout this book takes time. It takes  time to build a robust understanding of the context, time to under - stand what motivates our audience, time to craft the 3‐minute story  and form the Big Idea. It takes time to look at the data in different  ways and determine how to best show it. It takes time to declutter  and draw attention and iterate and seek feedback and iterate some  more to create an effective visual."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"One of my biggest tips for success in storytelling with data is to allow  adequate time for it. If we don’t consciously recognize that this takes  time to do well and budget accordingly, our time can be entirely  eaten up by the other parts of the analytical process. Consider the  typical analytical process: you start with a question or hypothesis,  then you collect the data, then you clean the data, and then you ana- lyze the data. After all of that, it can be tempting to simply throw the  data into a graph and call it “done.” But we simply aren’t doing ourselves—or our data—justice with this  approach."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"If you see a data visualiza- tion or example of storytelling with data that you like, consider how  you might adapt the approach for your own use. Pause to reflect on  what makes it effective. Make a copy of it and create a visual library  that you can add to over time and refer to for inspiration. Emulate  the good examples and approaches that you see."

B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"Now that we’ve looked at some specific tips for you to follow, let’s  turn to some ideas for building storytelling with data competency  in others. Building storytelling with data competency in your  team or organization I am a strong believer that anyone can improve their ability to com- municate with data by learning and applying the lessons we’ve cov- ered. That said, some will have more interest and natural aptitude  than others in this space. When it comes to being effective at com- municating with data in your team or your organization, there are a  few potential strategies to consider: upskill everyone, invest in an  expert, or outsource this part of the process. Let’s briefly discuss  each of these."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"Building storytelling with data competency in your team or organization  251 Upskill everyone As we’ve discussed, part of the challenge is that data visualization  is a single step in the analytical process. Those hired into analytical  roles typically have quantitative backgrounds that suit them well for  the other steps (finding the data, pulling it together, analyzing it,  building models), but not necessarily any formal training in design  to help them when it comes to the communication of the analysis. Also, increasingly those without analytical backgrounds are being  asked to put on analytical hats and communicate using data. For both of these groups, finding ways to impart foundational knowl - edge can make everyone better."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"On this latter note, here are  some specific ideas: •	Storytelling with data book club:  read a chapter at a time and  then discuss it together, identifying examples specific to your work  where the given lesson can be applied. •	Do‐it‐yourself workshop:  after finishing the book, conduct your  own workshop—soliciting examples of communicating with data  from your team and discussing how they can be improved. •	Makeover Monday:  challenge individuals to a weekly makeover  of less‐than‐ideal examples employing the lessons we’ve covered. •	Feedback loop:  set the expectation that individuals must share  work in progress and offer feedback to each other grounded in  the storytelling with data lessons. •	And the winner is:  introduce a monthly or quarterly contest, where  individuals or teams can submit their own examples of effective  storytelling with data then start a gallery of model examples,  adding to it over time via contest winners. Any of these approaches—alone or combined—can create and help  ensure continued focus on effective visualization and storytelling  with data. 252 final thoughts  Invest in an internal expert or two Another approach is to identify an individual or a couple of individuals  on your team or in your organization who are interested in data visu- alization (even better if they’ve already displayed some natural apti- tude) and invest in them so they can become your in‐house experts. Make it an expectation of their role to be an internal data visualization  consultant to whom others on the team can turn for brainstorming  and feedback or to overcome tool‐specific challenges. This invest- ment can take the form of books, tools, coaching, workshops, or  courses."
B6,Storytelling with data: a data visualization guide for business professionals,1,0,storytelling with data,"They recognize    Recap: a quick look at all we’ve learned  253 the importance of storytelling with data and invest in training and  practice to give everyone the foundational knowledge for effective  data visualization. They also identify and support an internal expert,  to whom the rest of the team can turn for help overcoming specific  challenges. They bring in external experts to learn from as makes  sense. They recognize the value of being able to tell stories with  data effectively and invest in their people to build this competency."

This is a book about  learning how to use the Data Studio  tool to visualize data and build useful reports and dashboards. Before we learn how to build different visual data representations, it’s important to first understand  the craft of storytelling with data and its utility. It will serve us well to take a step back and understand  the big picture. This introductory chapter sets the stage for understanding the meaning of data storytelling and its  importance. We will go through the components of a good data story, understand how data storytelling  manifests at work, and learn the key skills required to be a good storyteller. Finally, we will learn about  an approach to building effective data stories. In this chapter, we will cover the following main topics:  • Understanding data storytelling • Building data stories – an approach Understanding data storytelling Simply put, data storytelling  means telling a story using data. According to Brent Dykes, author of  the bestselling book Effective Data Storytelling , data storytelling is the skillful amalgamation of data,  narrative, and visuals. Why tell a story? Stories  are an integral part of our lives and are the most natural way we consume  and retain information. Compared to straightforward facts and messages, stories are memorable,  impressionable, relatable, and persuasive."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Introduction to Data Storytelling 4 Structuring a data story Stories can be told in different ways and can have different purposes. Some have a moral or a lesson to  teach, some report events, while others just entertain. In the simplest sense, a story has a beginning, a  middle, and an end. This basic structure is referred to as Aristotle’s arc, known to  have been introduced  by the ancient Greek philosopher."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Understanding data storytelling  5 Figure 1.3 – News story structure When a data story is created using the news story approach, it follows the following sequence of steps: 1. Share the key insight 2. Provide the context and causes 3. Details through drill-throughs/drill-downs A data story  can use either of these approaches depending on the presentation format, the audience,  and the objective of the narrator – to influence a decision, to inform, to trigger an action, and so on. If you are presenting data to an executive audience with little time to spare, you might want to follow  the news story approach by starting with the key insight. This will help you get their attention and  then you can delve into the details as needed. On the other hand, when you are trying to present a complex or counter-intuitive insight, you might  want to follow the more traditional approach of first setting the stage with the context and evidence,  then laying out the problem, drawing attention to the impact of this problem, and finally closing with  one or more solution recommendations."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data story,"The purpose  of a data story could either be explanatory, where we explain a phenomenon, or be  actionable, where we want to elicit an action or decision through actionable insights. While data can  also be used to describe a situation, the descriptive nature doesn’t typically make a story by itself. Data  on its own has no useful meaning. It needs to be gleaned for information and insights."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data stories,"Instances of powerful data stories that persuade action and influence decision making are ubiquitous. Consider a non-profit organization that is seeking donations for supporting cancer research. Sharing  personal stories of those who suffered from cancer and those who benefitted from the research  supported by the organization makes an incredible impact on the potential donors. Presenting a data  story around the effectiveness of the organization, the amount of money raised, the membership  growth, and the people served helps potential donors and volunteers to connect with the cause and  persuade them to take action."

Their sales are declining  and they would like to understand what action they can take to remedy the situation. By analyzing  sales and customer feedback data, they learned that over 30% of customers in the last 6 months have  experienced shipping delays and damage. These customers left poor reviews on the e-commerce site  and prominent social media forums, resulting in poor sales."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Data storytelling  is not the same thing as data visualization. While data visualization  refers to the  effective representation of data through graphics and visuals, data storytelling goes beyond just data  visualization. Visuals are critical but are only one component of data storytelling. Data storytelling  embeds data visuals in a narrative and presents a cohesive picture. Note Much of this book is focused on building great visualizations with Data Studio. We will touch  upon the narrative aspects of data storytelling where applicable. When building a data story, always start with understanding your data and identifying the key insight  or phenomenon you would like to share. Then create a narrative that you would like to take your users  or audience through. Follow that with sketching the scenes and designing the storyboard. Only then  work on building the visuals and presentation."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Further reading For a deeper understanding of the psychology of storytelling and various aspects of data stories,  read Brent Dykes’ book Effective Data Storytelling . Presenting data stories Data  stories can be presented either to a live audience for direct consumption or to an offline audience  to consume the content indirectly. Data stories can take many forms – documents, PowerPoint  presentations, videos, websites, dynamic dashboards, reports, and more. When you present directly  to the audience, you are in full control of the narrative. Y ou determine what the audience sees at any  point in time. Y ou can carefully walk them through your various story scenes in sequence, building  up the necessary tension and anticipation."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Perhaps the best example of data storytelling comes from the Swedish physician and public  speaker Hans Rosling’s iconic narration of the story of the world using augmented reality animation. Y ou can watch it on Y ouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo . Understanding data storytelling  7 On the other hand, when the intent is to present to an audience or users who will consume the content  later, the format can be static, such as in published reports or articles, or can be interactive, such as  on dashboards, websites, and so on, allowing the audience to interact with the content and explore. In offline consumption mode, you need to be really cautious about driving the desired user behavior  so that all users can interpret and understand the key insight or phenomenon consistently and with  little ambiguity. When the data is static and doesn’t change over time, as the narrator or storyteller, you know exactly  the insight or the message that needs to be conveyed and how best to present it. A good example  of using text and visuals to narrate a story about child mortality data  can be found at https:// vizhub.healthdata.org/child-mortality ."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data stories,"For this reason, it is static data that is the most amenable to creating data stories. However,  you will still benefit from the data storytelling approach to develop these dashboards to create as  cohesive a narrative as possible. Business dashboards are usually good at serving descriptive and  explanatory purposes. However, you can also strive to help users identify any insights easily through  intelligent design.

It is built using Google Analytics data  and is available for use as a template from the Data Studio Report Gallery . Report versus dashboard While I  often use the terms report  and dashboard  together or  interchangeably in this book, they actually  represent two distinct forms of presenting data and generally serve different purposes. However, the  concepts I discuss in this book apply to both constructs."

But it also embodies  the other components as you cannot generate insights and communicate effectively without first  understanding the data, working with the data, and thinking critically about the data. So, the key  skills required to be a good data storyteller are as follows: • Get and prepare the data  Identify the right data to address the problem at hand and obtain it. Y ou might have to work  with other teams to get access to that data. Or in the case of external data, you might have  to make an API call, scrape the web, or download the data yourself.  Clean the data, format it, and munge it appropriately (reshaping, aggregating, filtering, and  so on). • Analyze the data and generate insights  Explore the data and understand the trends and relationships among different attributes. Create new metrics and apply analytical methods to glean insights. • Visualize the data  Visualize the data in appropriate charts."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Data storytelling is an essential skill that allows for effective communication through data. Simplicity   can be thought of as the mantra of data storytelling so that anyone and everyone can understand the  message and insight clearly and unambiguously. However, certain complex problems and phenomena  might require a little more advanced representation and nuanced interpretation. A higher level of data  literacy among stakeholders ensures that such data stories drive quality decision making. At work, data storytelling usually manifests in the form of static slide decks, documents, and spreadsheets  or dynamic dashboards and reports. The next section explains an approach that we can follow to build  effective dynamic dashboards and reports based on the tenets of data storytelling described in the  first section of this chapter. Building data stories – an approach  11 Building data stories – an approach Business  dashboards and reports pose unique challenges in crafting a story owing to the   dynamic nature of the data they support. In this section, we are going to learn about the 3-D approach  to designing and building effective dashboards. The approach consists of three main stages as shown  in the following figure: Figure 1.5 – Stages of the data storytelling approach In the Determine  stage, you  need to work on determining the audience for the dashboard, the key  business questions they need answering, and the data required to answer those questions. In the Design   stage, you will work on the narrative, select the right visuals, and identify the required interactive  controls. In  the Develop  stage, you create the visuals and implement the right colors and visual cues  for a seamless user experience. In this final stage, you will choose the appropriate delivery method  and accordingly deploy and share the dashboard or the report."

Trying to meet the needs  of multiple personas with a single dashboard is a recipe for disaster, which could leave all  users less than satisfied. On the other hand, a report can accommodate the needs of multiple  personas and be as comprehensive and detailed as needed.  • Business questions : Identify the key business questions from the identified persona(s) and  define critical analytical user journeys. Have a clear understanding of the problem the dashboard  is going to address and the supporting evidence required. • Data : Find the data needed to address the business questions and provide additional context."

Develop Once you have crafted the  narrative, designed the layout, identified the right metrics, and chosen the  appropriate visualizations, it’s time to develop the dashboard by implementing the design. Y ou start  with connecting to the data and building the metrics. Y ou then develop each individual chart and  arrange them according to the layout design."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,Walking through an example Let’s deepen our understanding of the 3-D data storytelling approach  to building dashboards with  an example. A UK-based online retail company sells unique all-occasion gifts to its largely wholesale  customer base. It caters to customers across many countries. We are going to build a dashboard in Data  Studio based on its online sales data.
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Introduction to Data Storytelling 14 Determine  The target audience for this dashboard is going to be the director of international business. The key objective of this persona is to improve international business by increasing revenue, the  customer base, and expanding to more countries. They need to understand how sales are generated  from various countries, spot trends and anomalies, and ultimately identify opportunities for expansion. The director has requested a summary dashboard to monitor the year-to-date and month-to-date sales  metrics for international countries."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data stories,"Next, we need to identify the right visualizations based on the chosen metrics and the questions that  need to be answered:  • The proportion of international business compared to the whole : We can use a pie or donut  chart to show the proportion of an attribute value compared to the whole • Weekly/monthly sales trends broken down by new versus repeat customer sales : We can  use a stacked bar chart to compare sales by new versus repeat customers over time and add a  line to represent the total sales so that the trend is easier to perceive Building data stories – an approach  15 • Top countries by sales and number of customers : A bar chart is a great choice to compare  multiple dimension values for easy comparison • Top products by sales : Again, a bar chart is a great fit here • Sales trends of top products over time : A simple time series is best represented by a line chart • Revenue distribution across different countries : A filled map provides a single-glance view   of the geographical presence and approximate ranking of different geographical regions. Now is the time to build the narrative and create a wireframe for the dashboard. It involves designing the  layout of the dashboard and placing the visuals and other components of the dashboard appropriately  on the page. It could be a simple sketch on paper, whiteboard, or digital notes application."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Introduction to Data Storytelling 16 As the target audience, The Director of International Business, expects to consume most of the  information at a glance, there are no explicit interactive filters that need to be designed. Given that,  having a country filter to enable users to select a particular country and look at the metrics per country  may be helpful. We can leverage the cross-filtering capability of the reporting tool (Data Studio) and  have the filled map chart serve as a country filter. Selecting a country from the map can filter the  remaining charts on the dashboard."
B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Summary In this chapter, we have discussed what data storytelling is and how it’s distinguished from data  visualization. We have understood the core elements of a data story and how data stories differ for  static and dynamic content. We have learned about the 3-D approach  to building data stories for  dashboards that comprises three major stages: determine, design, and develop. In the determine stage,  we determine the target users of the dashboard, the key business questions that the dashboard needs  to address, and the data required to answer those questions. In the design stage, we build the narrative,  define the right metrics, and choose the right visualizations and interactivity. Finally, in the develop  stage, we actually build the visuals and interactions and choose the colors and other visual aspects."

In the next chapter, we will be taking this understanding a step further and will learn about foundational  principles of data storytelling, best practices of visualization, choosing the right chart types, and other  design aspects.  2 Principles of Data   Visualization Data storytelling  is both an art and a science. The art part refers to the story structure and narrative  elements that bind data and visual components together, whereas the science part of data storytelling  pertains to the foundational principles of design and visual perception and their application. This  book largely concerns itself with building data stories through dashboards and reports. It primarily  deals with the science aspect of data storytelling. These forms of data presentation provide limited  narrative flexibility owing to the dynamic nature of the data they represent. As the data changes over  time, the insights it conveys and the story it tells will change accordingly. This makes it difficult to  incorporate a rigid narrative."

B7,Data Storytelling with Google Looker Studio: A hands-on guide to using Looker Studio for building compelling and effective dashboards,1,0,data storytelling,"Summary  49 Summary Data storytelling is a skillful amalgamation of narrative and visual representation. In this chapter, we  learned about the design principles that form the foundation for building effective and compelling  data visualizations. These principles are rooted in the nature of human vision and perception. We  reviewed the centuries-old but still very much applicable Gestalt principles of visual perception and  looked at three major guiding themes for data storytelling in this chapter. We understood that simplicity is the hallmark of a great data story. Keeping things simple and to the  point and removing all noise and distractions from the design are key to a great UX. Going further, we  learned that organizing the layout of the dashboard to present a cohesive picture and fit the intended  narrative is important. Above all, representing the data accurately should be the main goal."

Wells returned to Memphis from a promotional tour for her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech . She found the city in peril – a white mob had lynched three Black men  after a confict between a white man and a Black man had escalated for a few days. Wells began to research why those and many other lynchings happened – by  using what we know today as data reporting techniques."

Wells.  “Data journalism has been important – crucial – for more than 30 years now,”  said Lise Olsen, an investigative reporter and editor at the Texas Observer  whose  work has appeared in Inside Climate, NBC, Houston Chronicle , and in documen - taries on A&E and CNN. “Without knowing how to analyze data, a journalist  must go nearly blind into the world of reporting.  “So much data is digital, that if a reporter doesn’t know how to interpret num - bers, statistics or recognize basic formats, he or she will miss crucial opportunities  or be far too easily fooled by spin masters and fake news.”  What Is Data Journalism? What makes it data journalism isn’t the form, it’s the starting point in a data source we corralled, cleaned and interpreted.  – Melissa Bell, Vox Media publisher  Those words, written by Bell in 2015, best summarize Data + Journalism ’s ap- proach. Data journalism is the use of data and statistical analysis to uncover, better explain and/or provide context to a news story."

Either way, reporters, editors and designers follow a process to tell those stories. Specialized data journalism skills focus on acquiring, cleaning, analyzing and  visualizing data, a process we follow in this book (Figure 0.2):  Figure 0.2 The data reporting process (Illustration/Billy O’Keefe).                                                                 4 Introduction: The Power of Data Storytelling  • Acquiring data  includes knowing what public records exist and how to ob - tain them, as well as seeking numbers suitable for spreadsheets or databases.  • Cleaning data  involves software and human intelligence to standardize spell - ing, punctuation and formatting to obtain accurate counts.  • Analyzing data  may be accomplished with spreadsheets, programming lan - guages, database management systems or visual representations to fnd com - monalities or outliers.  • Presenting data  involves building maps, interactive charts or graphics to en - able audiences to comprehend the analysis or personalize the data through  interactives. This book follows that reporting process, offering the skills and exercises journal - ists need to practice the craft. It is much like a Swiss Army knife – it exposes you to many aspects of data journalism, ranging from coding to point-and-click tools. You’ll work with RStudio and SQL to analyze data."
B8,Data + Journalism A Story-Driven Approach to Learning Data Reporting,1,0,data story,"How important is a human element in a data story? Alvin Chang, head of data  and visuals at The Guardian US , said each source gives him a slightly sharper view  of the issue he’s writing about. But he often wonders if his biases led him to talk to a self-selecting group of people. “What if I just needed to talk to more people? What if I’m missing the larger story?  “It forces us to test the theses of our stories using the scientifc method, rather  than just through our individual experiences,” Chang said. “Sometimes it reveals human experiences that we weren’t previously aware of."
B8,Data + Journalism A Story-Driven Approach to Learning Data Reporting,1,0,data storytelling,"Introduction: The Power of Data Storytelling 5  “If you have a data-oriented frame of mind, it will help you in everything you  do, not just in your journalism career, but in your life,” he said. “Everything  is data, and the quicker you understand that, the faster you’ll be able to fnd stories.  “It’s just another skill in your toolbox, but an important one that lifts your work  to greater heights, gives it more of a scientifc or academic rigor, and makes your stories potentially be even more powerful.”  Heather Cherone, the politics reporter at WTTW News, the PBS station in  Chicago, uses data reporting on a regular basis on her coverage of city hall and the state legislature. She says data skills are “crucial for all journalists.”  “The world we live in is awash in data,” she said. “Our job is to help make sense  of that raw information by translating it into clear knowledge that informs the lives of our readers and viewers.  “To do that, journalists have to know how to fnd that data, which often takes  old-fashioned reporting. It is also important to analyze that data without fear or favor and without a desired conclusion.”  Ethics, Trust and Data  Lynn Walsh is the co-founder and assistant director of Trusting News, which  teaches journalists how to be more open and build trust with readers. Part of her job is to help data journalists learn how to be more transparent in their reporting and explain the process we cover in this book."

Explaining how we get data (freedom of information or  public records) and the limits of the data – what it does not include because it was not collected by the agency – is also helpful, Walsh said.  “We should realize a lot of people do not know what FOI is or that the general  public has a right to access certain information,” she said. “Adding media literacy elements explaining how public records work can also be helpful to the audience.  “If we do not explain these elements of our reporting, people will make as - sumptions that we are purposefully trying to hide data, push a certain agenda, etc. Also, if you do create your own database and collect your own data, explain why you had to do this, as the data didn’t exist, why you thought it was important to invest the time in doing this and how you did it.”  Impact of Data Journalism  Data journalism walks hand in hand with investigative reporting, which is why so many data reporting skills are taught at annual conferences such as Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) and the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR). Data and public records lend credibility to investigative sto - ries and reaffrm one of journalism’s basic premises: Show, don’t tell."

She and many other data journalists are the frst to tell you: Great data  stories don’t read like data stories. They are stories about how issues impact human  beings. In this chapter, you’ll explore how to focus your data stories with a human- centered narrative approach, how to simplify your writing with just a few numbers per paragraph, how to scale the data to make sense to the reader and how to fnd key data points that can be buried in reports and databases. Earlier chapters ex - plore how to research, scrape, analyze and draw data points from datasets. Now let’s see how to turn it into stories that make a difference.

Why? Because stories are memorable. People relate to them, and they inspire emo - tions and reactions from the reader."
B8,Data + Journalism A Story-Driven Approach to Learning Data Reporting,1,0,data story,"Adopting a narrative structure, a data story typically starts with an anecdote on  the current issue, uses data and other anecdotal support that builds up to the key fndings and usually ends with a “call to action” that gives the readers choices at the end of the story: Read a related story, how to get help, comment, answer a poll, etc. A great example of this approach came in a June 2018 Arizona Republic  story by  Arizona State University student journalists Nate Fain, Daniel Perle and Veronica Graff. They wrote an in-depth piece about a group of NFL players’ lawsuit against the  league over its poor handling of ongoing concussions with current and former players.

B8,Data + Journalism A Story-Driven Approach to Learning Data Reporting,1,0,data stories,"While this is not a “one-size-fts - all” model for writing data stories, it’s a common approach for when reporters are trying to show how the issue impacts people while also weaving the data into the story. There’s a running joke among data journalists not to make the reader “numb”  with numbers – don’t overwhelm them with data. While data can be an interest - ing way to tell the story, journalism is most often about those being impacted by the data: People. And who’s reading the stories?"

But if you instead open it with a person  who’s been impacted by this nefarious  thing, as an example of the larger issue, the reader can now connect with this person’s struggle.”  Boyle’s next step: Explain what the data you found shows. Then show more  people from this community. Then you explain the choices that were made that led to this situation."

Humans, and how we deal with one another, are almost always the real  part of the story, Boyle said.  “Behind most data analyses are human decisions that led to whatever you found,”  he said. “That’s a policy decision. Or it’s a lack of enforcement of something. Or people turning a blind eye."
B8,Data + Journalism A Story-Driven Approach to Learning Data Reporting,1,0,data stories,Seven Common Angles for Data Stories  Paul Bradshaw’s Online Journalism Blog outlines seven common angles for data journalism stories. Consider these when you’re starting to research a data-driven story and when you start writing it.  1. Scale:  How big is an issue?  2. Change/stasis: This is going up/down/not improving.  3.

Cherone’s reporting relied on data from Chicago’s annual comprehensive f - nancial report, which is a dense 236-page document. To begin the process, she looked at the actual spending by each of the City Council’s 19 committees in 2020 and compared that to what each committee was authorized to spend by the 2020 city budget. Then she compared the actual spending of each committee with the spending by Austin’s committee."

Here are some ways to declutter your writing by simplifying numbers and presenting them in a concise way:  • 29,912 can be rounded up: Nearly 30,000.  • Round off percentages, too: 62.2 percent is 62 percent; 79.9 percent is  80 percent; 75 percent is three-fourths or three in four.  • 12.55 percent of women and 25 percent of men can be one in eight  women and one in four men.  • Instead of a 100 percent increase, say it doubled. Instead of a 200 per - cent increase, say it tripled. It’s easier for the reader to understand.  • Break data into bullet-point lists and pullout boxes like this.  • Could the data be better presented in a chart, infographic or database?"

She wrote:  Evictions rebounded signifcantly in October 2021 as compared with October 2020, when the restrictions were in place as the second wave of COVID-19 swept  Chicago and Illinois. Cook County judges approved only 322 evictions in October 2020, as compared with 1,866 in October 2021, according to the data  In Chicago, 1,278 households were evicted from their homes in October 2021,  along with 42 businesses, according to the data. In suburban Cook County, an additional 566 households were evicted, along with 22 businesses, according to the data.  * * *  Alvin Chang, head of data and visuals at The Guardian US , said data is “merely a  structured collection of stories.”  “So that means you can do two things with it: You can look at the dataset as  a whole and see the big trends."

When done right, a thread can engage a social media audience in a very meaningful way. Twitter threads are an effective way for data journalists to explain the research,  reporting and visualization process to readers. If the reporter or designer is keep - ing a data diary – a Google or Word document with a running narrative of the reporting, writing and visualization process – those diary highlights can easily  transform into a Twitter thread."

B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"i Storytelling with Data in Healthcare With the constant evolution of change in healthcare from both a technology and  governmental perspective, it is imperative to take a step back and view the big pic - ture. Relying on hunches or beliefs is no longer sustainable, so avoid jumping to  conclusions and making decisions without thoroughly understanding the statistics  being analyzed. The triple aim of statistics is a conceptual model laying the foun - dation for improving healthcare outcomes through statistics. This foundation is:  know your numbers; develop behavioral interventions; and set goals to drive  change."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"Storytelling with Data in Healthcare  combines methodology and statistics in the  same course material, making it coherent and easier to put into practice. It uses  storytelling as a tool for knowledge acquisition and retention and will be valuable  for courses in nursing schools, medical schools, pharmacy schools, or any healthcare  profession that has a research design or statistics course offered to students. The  book will be of interest to researchers, academics, healthcare professionals, and  students in the fields of healthcare management and operations as well as statistics  and data visualization.

B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"The goal by the end of this book is to enhance or fine tune your skills by  incorporating techniques/ tools to effectively explain statistics and leverage the  power of storytelling with data. In reflecting back to sitting in a high school math  class, we wondered how it was possible to multiply or add letters in an equation. The concept of multiplying various letters or having a letter mean something        2 Introduction2 other than the ones used to create words that make up sentences is confusing. When looking at art or a photograph and feelingan emotional connection, why  is it possible to describe how you feel in words?"
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"Remember, the  pathway to storytelling with data begins with STATISTICS. Never lose sight of  the purpose of what you are trying to do. Every statistical analysis begins with a  foundation that we call the Three Pillars of Statistics (Figure  1.1). Figure 1.1   Three Pillars of Statistics."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"Creating Graphs There are many ways of storytelling with data, but an effective method is one  that generates more questions than answers. One way to use the insight learned  from experience is to leverage various statistics to create a cohesive story. A graph - ical representation of statistics provides an easy- to- understand visual of the data.        74 Patient Experience74 Run/  control charts were one effective graphical display to trend data over time. Overall, there are many decisions/  choices for graphically displaying data to  achieve effective results."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"Any piece of information included within a survey is valuable,  so don’t forget to leverage the analysis of demographic questions and national  benchmarks to maximize multiple viewpoints when storytelling with data. Additionally, take advantage of the power of statistics if the organization has the  raw data. The statistical analysis conducted when raw data is available is robust and  powerful compared to only having descriptive data. Raw data allows the oppor - tunity to analyze results at a high level and drill down to departments/ positions  and calculate statistics, such as means, standard deviation, confidence intervals,  regression techniques, p values, or statistical significance to enhance the story."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"CMS Hospital Compare  147147 STOP and Ask Questions to Plan for Improvement The final step to storytelling with data is to leverage the methodological approach  and statistical interpretation to develop behavioral- based interventions or process  improvements for the future. Analyzing all available information is paramount to  deriving conclusions from the statistics being presented. A proper plan can prevent  poor performance. Having a plan for implementing an intervention begins with a  plan, so STOP and ask questions. • SMART goal –  develop disease- specific interventions to reduce the current  observed mortality rate by 5% in 1 year. • Think critically –  3 years of historical data on Medicare patients over 65 years  old."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"The final chapter is a cul - mination of the methodological approach to utilize the STATISTICS toolkit for  storytelling with data. Discussion Questions • Think of situations where change was implemented based on experience and  another situation where it was based on facts. What were the successes and  failures of both approaches? • Have you ever sat in a presentation where data was presented based on  assumptions and experience, but the discussion was led to be fact? What were  your reactions? • Do you believe that patients are becoming more analytically savvy when  making healthcare decisions?"
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"T ogether, statistics and research methodology are powerful forces used in  storytelling with data. The only limit to what can be achieved is based on your  own creativity. The Art of a Question When analyzing data and making decisions take a step back and don’t jump to  conclusions. Changing behavior within others and yourself takes time."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"The Three Pillars of  Statistics is a conceptual model to categorize the framework for methodological  storytelling with data (Figure 10.1).  1. Know your numbers –  critically think, evaluate, and DEFINE statistics.  2. Develop behavioral interventions –  know how you’re being measured and  create processes to change behavior through a focus on the FACTS.  3. Set goals to drive change –  STOP to develop achievable methodological goals  to drive change."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"This toolkit provides the framework towards a methodological approach  to analyzing data or storytelling with data to convey a message effectively. We all  have the power to leverage different pictures (Cinderella’s castle, Rorschach ink  blot, and a control chart) and translate them into stories. These stories may be  interpreted differently depending on the individual telling the story and experi - ence/  education of the storyteller. Any variation (validity threat) in the story from  what is intended is problematic."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"Remember, the pathway to storytelling with data begins with STATISTICS.  1. Step back and don’t jump to conclusions ( Chapter 1 ).  2. Think methodologically ( Chapter 2 ).  3. Analyze the metric ( Chapter 3 ).  4."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"Take the time to understand the formulas used to derive the statistics  and a little creativity to maximize the power behind storytelling with data. At this  point, the process of integrating research methodology ( Chapter 2 ) and statistics  (Chapter  3 ) begins with exploring mortality and readmission using graphical  representations, such as run charts and control charts. The importance of focusing on mortality and readmission is a result of hos - pital performance and financial penalties/ incentives that are part of these two  metrics and knowing these metrics are part of multiple governmental programs. Implementing change is accomplished through monitoring process and out - come metrics."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"Once  all statistical data has been collected and analyzed along with using any necessary  tools (i.e., DEFINE, FACTS, STOP , etc.) to generate quantitative and qualitative  data, the process of storytelling with data and deriving conclusions begins. The overall conclusions drawn from any type of statistics lead to alternative  explanations (i.e., threats to validity). Having the tools and skill set to question  the displayed results leads to a greater internalization of the presented metrics. Creating excuses, becoming defensive, or deflecting the story told by statistics  doesn’t solve the problem."
B10,Storytelling with Data in Healthcare,1,0,storytelling with data,"The pathway to storytelling with data begins with statistics  and ends with a proactive approach to hitting those moving targets. This inter - pretation involves the ability and skill to recognize the type of statistics presented,  understand what it means, and effectively interpret them to develop the insight to  ask the right question to assess, monitor, and drive improvement efforts. Prior to moving towards developing sustainable interventions or solutions,  it’s important to reflect on what has been discussed. Matejka and Fitzmaurice  (2017) developed 12 different visual displays of data with identical statistical  properties, highlighting that multiple graphical representations result in different  stories, which leads to questions of doubt and opens up opportunities for criti - cism."

B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"So it is with data stories. As we learn to communicate the results of our analysis—the hidden secrets carefully plucked from within the rows and columns of our data and curated into insight—we mature from being okay with being told something, to wanting to see it for ourselves, and, eventually, to wanting to interact with it. We need more—more information, more context, more action, and more substance. It’s not “see Jane run” anymore, it’s “let’s talk about how fast Jane ran from Point A to Point B and, more important, why (and if) that’s actually important.” And sometimes, we learn something entirely new and unexpected."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"Today, the concept of data storytelling is reshaping stories of all forms, from news media and journalism, to boardroom reports and conference presentations, to even how we script documentaries and educational programming. If you have seen any conference presentations over the past couple of years, or watched a TED talk, or read an article out of the New York Times, or listened to National Public Radio, or watched an episode of Cosmos, then you have witnessed data storytelling in action. It’s a trend that we—from the classroom to the boardroom—are jumping on with more velocity than you might imagine. Students from grade school to graduate school are working hands-on with data and changing the way they learn about and communicate about information. Business analysts, managers, and executives are moving away from static, statistic-laden reports and toward interactive, visual data dashboards."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"Journalists and news editors the world over are using data storyboards and engaging, often interactive, infographics to share information with society-at-large—in print, online, and across form factors. Visualizing our data helps us to see trends and patterns. Telling stories about our data helps us to connect with it. Combined, visual data storytelling pushes beyond the boundaries of simply analyzing information to providing the capacity to communicate it in ways that leave a meaningful, lasting impact. Together, these converge into what I’ve termed the “visual imperative,” a paradigm shift that is radically reshaping how we work with and seek to understand our data, big and small. This visual imperative is reforming our expectations of information, changing the question from “what can we do with our data” to “what can our data do for us.” And, it’s making its mark on every aspect of a progressively data-driven culture, too. From traditional business intelligence and data discovery, to the personal analytics on our smart devices and wearable technologies, to the manner in which we are using data recipes to cook up our new favorite television shows (I’m looking at you, Netflix), we are becoming more data-dependent and data-driven than ever before."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"This led me to focus my research on data visualization and visual analytics, and, eventually, on visual data storytelling. I learned how critical data visualization truly is to communicating the results of data analysis and discovery to enrich the intelligence that is provided to decision makers and leaders within any organization and how a compelling visual narrative can transform insight into action. Then, as I transitioned from industry into academia, I recognized firsthand the importance of careful planning and foresight in communicating data, as narratives begin to take form and we build visualizations to support story arcs. More specifically, as I watched education translate into application, I recognized this isn’t an intuitive and obvious process."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"If my previous book was the use case to support the visual imperative, then this book is the how-to guide to put it into action with visual data storytelling. For lack of a better phrase, I’m done pontificating: it’s time to get our hands dirty. THREE CORE TAKEAWAYS This book focuses on giving you the foundational knowledge, contextualized learning, and hands-on skills you need to be successful in leveraging the power of data visualization to tell compelling data stories. The goal is not to inundate you with academic lessons in the science of data visualization or story composition, nor to provide a full-scale training experience on any particular software or technical application, but instead to provide guidance as you build the necessary skills to produce visual data narratives within the context of business communication. Therefore, this book concentrates on helping you learn how to organize your data and structure analysis with stories in mind; to embrace exploration and the visual discovery process; and to articulate your findings with rich data, purposefully curated visualizations, and skillfully crafted narrative frameworks. Ultimately, these presentations can help you to deliver your business message while satisfying the needs of your audience."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"What you will learn from this book includes the following:  Why we tell stories and what visual data storytelling is  The difference between data visualization for analysis versus presentation  How to tell visual stories that communicate insights and make an impact  How to leverage questions to design logical and fruitful data collection and analysis  How to create important graphs in Tableau and know which chart to use  How to utilize concepts of design in data visualization and storytelling  How to best storyboard your story for your message based on your audience  How to direct your audience's attention to the most important parts of your data story  How to design effective business presentations to showcase your data story with Tableau WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR This book is for anyone who has data and wants to use it to communicate something to someone else in an engaging and memorable way. This includes, but is not limited to:  Analysts sharing the results of their data discovery or analysis  Students communicating data for reports or presentations  Teachers helping learners (of any age) to cultivate visual data literacy  Executives and business managers reporting data-driven results or metrics  Journalists giving data the starring role in their editorials Essentially, if you have some data and want to tell a story about it to someone else, then this book is for you. So, from the most savvy of data users to students just beginning to learn about the power of data visualization in business communications, as long as you are interested in becoming a better visual data storyteller, then you’re in the right place! There are no prerequisites for this book. In fact, it might actually be preferable if you’re coming into this text with fresh eyes and a fresh perspective. We start with the basics and build incrementally on concepts and to move through the data storytelling process from beginning to end."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"Don’t let the topic overwhelm you: Whether or not you have been practicing data visualization and visual analysis for some time or are just beginning, you don’t have to be a statistician or a computer scientist, a graphic designer, or even a well- trained writer to learn how to navigate the art and science that is data visualization or to become a master data storyteller. Likewise, you do not need to be a data visualization expert or come armed with deep technical expertise in visualization software packages. Although this book utilizes Tableau as the primary mechanism for data visualization, you need not be a power user or expert prior to getting started—you don’t even have to have a purchased license on your machine! You can simply download a free trial of Tableau Desktop version 10 or higher to get started—and we’ll go through that process together, too."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"I realize that the idea of visual analysis or data storytelling might sound intimidating to many and that learning new software is always a challenge. Therefore, this book is designed in a way that a professor or a tutor might teach visual data storytelling (and in fact is the approach I take in my classrooms for undergraduate- and graduate-level students) using what I call the 1-2-3 Method (see Figure P.3). This breaks down like this: (1) grounding easy-to-understand principles (2) reinforcing these through real-world examples, and (3) guided hands-on work to incrementally develop skills. By the time you have worked your way through each of the chapters and exercises in this book you will walk away with something tangible: competency as a visual data storyteller using your own data in your own dashboards and presentations. And you’ll have some great visuals on your Tableau Public profile that you can add to your resume! Figure P.3 The 1-2-3 Method. ASSUMPTIONS To write a comprehensive text on any of the topics covered in this book would take several volumes and the combined mind power of multiple subject matter experts and scholars across industry and academia."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"WHY TABLEAU If you browse the shelves of your local bookstore, you’ll find several wonderful books available that teach data visualization and data storytelling skills in a tool-agnostic manner. (I’ve included some of these titles in the recommended reading resources in Chapter 10.) There is a good reason for this. To borrow the aptly stated words of Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, author of Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals, “No matter how good the tool, it will never know your data or its story like you do.” With any software there will always be weak points to balance out the strong ones. However, my goal in this book is to not only give you the information you need but the application to use it. For that, we need a tool. Many software packages are available on the market that would serve as capable platforms to support this book, including Excel, which is still the most ubiquitous, if unexciting, analysis tool, with the capability to functionally create basic charts and graphs."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"Another aspect of Tableau that I find impressive and worthwhile to a larger data storytelling movement is its focus on building a community of data users. I encourage you to join the Tableau Community and connect with the resources and peers you will find there. HOW TO USE THIS TEXT Like traditional classroom instruction, this book’s chapters are organized as individual modules that will be your guide as you learn how to go beyond the dashboard to communicate business-relevant implications of data analyses using the analytic, visualization, and storytelling capabilities of Tableau. Some chapters provide complete coverage of a story, from data collection to a completed storyboard."

B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"CHAPTER 1 STORYTELLING IN A DIGITAL ERA This chapter sets the context for the rest of this book with an introductory discussion on data visualization and visual data storytelling. It explores how these two concepts are similar and different and how both practices have been transformed in the digital era by new technologies and bigger, more diverse, and more dynamic data. Lastly, the chapter explores the value of visual data storytelling for data communication, and establishes how data storytelling is the perfect skill to bridge the very broad and expansive business—IT gap. A VISUAL REVOLUTION A data revolution is happening across the globe. From academics to politics and everywhere in between, the world’s stories are being told through their data points. Although using visualization to tell stories about data isn’t particularly new (in fact, as you’ll soon discover, we’ve been doing it for quite some time), we are now telling them in more influential and impactful ways than ever before."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"We can use several proven narrative frameworks to design a data storyboard, and numerous quintessential examples exist where a data storyteller has exercised a generous amount of creative liberty and done something entirely new. After all, like any kind of story, data stories require a certain amount of creativity—and although tools and technology can do much with our data for us, creativity is a uniquely human contribution to any narrative (see Figure 1.2). We’ll take a look at some of these examples as we go forward. note Data visualization is the practice of graphically representing data to help people see and understand patterns, insights, and other discoveries hidden inside information. Data storytelling translates seeing into meaning by weaving a narrative around the data to answer questions and support decision making. Data visualization and data storytelling are not the same thing; however, they are two sides of the same coin. A true data story utilizes data visualizations as a literary endeavor would use illustrations—proof points to support the narrative. However, there’s a little bit of a role reversal here: whereas data visualizations provide the “what” in the story, the narrative itself answers the “why.” As such, the two work together in tandem to translate raw data into something meaningful for its audience. So, to be a proper data storyteller you need to know how to do both: curate effective data visualizations and frame a storyboard around them. This starts with learning how to visualize data, and more importantly, how to do so in the best way for communication rather than purely analytical purposes. As discussed later in this book, visualizations for analysis versus presentation are not always the same thing in data storytelling. One of the most common clichés in the viz space is that “data visualizations are only as effective as the insights they reveal.” In this context, effectiveness is a function of careful planning."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"Figure 1.2 A sampling of great data stories in recent headlines by statisticians and data journalists. Data visualization is a place where science meets art, although the jury is still out on whether the practice is more a scientific endeavor or an artistic one. Although experts agree that a compelling visual requires both, it tends to be something of a chicken and egg scenario. We haven’t quite come to a consensus as to whether science comes before design or we design for the science—and the decision changes depending on whom you ask, who is creating the visualization, and who its audience is."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"The lessons in this book will guide you as you begin your first adventures in data storytelling using data visualizations in Tableau. FROM VISUALIZATION TO VISUAL DATA STORYTELLING: AN EVOLUTION With all the current focus on data visualization as the best (and sometimes only) way to see and understand today’s biggest and most diverse data, it’s easy to think of the practice as a relatively new way of representing data and other statistical information. In reality, the practice of graphing information—and communicating visually— reaches back all the way to some of our earliest prehistoric cave drawings where we charted minutiae of early human life, through initial mapmaking, and into more modern advances in graphic design and statistical graphics. Along the way, the practice of data visualization has been aided by both advancements in visual design and cognitive science as well as technology and business intelligence, and these have given rise to the advancements that have led to our current state of data visualization."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"It’s a central way that we learn, remember, and communicate information—which has important implications when the goal of a visualization or visual data story is to prepare business decision makers to leave a data presentation with a story in their head that helps them both remember your message and take action on it. We’ll discuss the cognitive and anthropological effects of stories more in later chapters. Graphing stories is the intersection of data visualization and storytelling. American author Kurt Vonnegut is quoted as having famously said, “There is no reason that the simple shapes of stories can’t be fed into a computer—they have beautiful shapes.” Likewise, we could restate this to say that data stories provide the shapes to communicate information in ways that facts and figures alone can’t. Just as much as today’s approach to data visualization has changed the way we see and understand our data, data storytelling has equally—if not more —been the catalyst that has radically changed the way we talk about our data. Learning to present insights and deliver the results of analysis in visual form involves working with data, employing analytical approaches, choosing the most appropriate visualization techniques, applying visual design principles, and structuring a compelling data narrative. Also, although crafting an effective and compelling visual data story is, like traditional storytelling, a uniquely human experience, tools and software exist that can help. Referring back to Vonnegut’s quote, stories have shapes. In visual data storytelling, we find the shape of the story through exploration of the data, conduct analysis to discover the sequence of the data points, and use annotations to layer knowledge to tell a story. To visualize the data storytelling process, consider the graphic shown in Figure 1.3. This is the process we’ll follow throughout this book. It’s worthwhile to note that this process isn’t always as straightforward or linear as it might initially appear. In reality, this process is, like all discovery processes, iterative."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"FROM VISUAL TO STORY: BRIDGING THE GAP Before we move into building skills and competencies in visual data storytelling, let’s take a moment to pause and think about why we are doing this. We’ve danced around this already in previous conversations, and while we could make a convincing argument that mastering new tools and ways to interact with data is an inevitable result of the big data era, that would only be half of the reason. Data will continue to grow, technologies to adapt and innovate, and analytical approaches to chart new territory in how we work with and try to uncover meaning and value hidden within our data. The real value in becoming a data storyteller is to amass the ability to share—to communicate —about our data."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"When we discuss the importance of communication skills within the context of data storytelling we are looking at it from an audience-first perspective. This means putting the audience’s needs ahead of the storytellers. Successful communication hinges on the ability to influence the people who matter the most—the stakeholder to your analysis, be that an executive, a teacher, the general public, or anyone else. Ultimately, how data—visual or otherwise—is interpreted is fundamentally influenced by context."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"We’ll take a deeper look at how to best curate “dessert charts” for visual data storytelling in Chapter 7, “Preparing Data for Storytelling.” DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION GETS ON THE MAP By now we are all in agreement: The business of data is changing. Business users are more empowered to work with data; IT is shifting its focus to be less about control and more about enablement. New data science job descriptions—like data scientist and visual data artist—are springing up as companies look for the right people with the right skill sets to squeeze more value from their data. Data itself is getting bigger, hardware more economical, and analytical software more “self-service.” We’ve embraced the paradigm shift from traditional BI to iterative data discovery."

We will ground these lessons by taking time to understand what makes data visualization and stories so influential to the human brain from both a cognitive and an anthropological perspective. THE SCIENCE OF STORYTELLING The world of data is changing. So is how we tell stories about it."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"Media and journalists are not the only ones putting emphasis on data storytelling, although they arguably have been a particularly imaginative bunch of communicators. Today we’ve seen the power of storytelling used to color in conversations on just about every type of data imaginable— from challenging astronomical principles, to visualizing the tenure pipeline at Harvard Business School, to quantifying the fairytale of Little Red Riding Hood. In every organization and every industry, data stories are becoming the next script for how we share information. For as diverse as data stories can be, they all have one thing in common: They give us something to connect to in a very literal sense. Let’s delve into the power of stories, first by looking behind the curtain at the science of storytelling and then looking at some incredible data stories over time to see how they have capitalized on the secret sauce of storytelling.1 The Brain on Stories In Chapter 1 I mentioned that evidence exists of the cognitive effects of storytelling embedded within our neurology. Here’s how: When we are presented with data, only two parts of our brain respond. These are Wernicke’s area—responsible for language comprehension—and Broca’s area—responsible, again, for language processing. For the very powerful human brain, data is easy."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"Data stories, above all, must be true. They are works of narration, but of the non-fiction variety. Okay, so we love stories—but why? There’s no easy answer to this question, and frankly from academe to industry, the research is crowded with books and articles attempting to explain the cognitive basis of all storytelling and literature under the heading of storytelling psychology."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"THE POWER OF STORIES We’ve established that data stories are powerful, and that they are powerful because of their ability to communicate information, generate understanding and knowledge, and stick in our brains. However, as information assets, visual data stories have a few other noteworthy qualities. But first, let’s set the record straight. There is much to be said about how visual data stories creating meaning in a time of digital data deluge, but it would be careless to relegate data storytelling to the role of “a fun new way to talk about data.” In fact, it has radically changed the way we talk about data (though certainly not invented the concept). The traditional charts and graphs we’ve always used to represent data are still helpful because they help us to better visually organize and understand information. They’ve just become a little static. With today’s technology, fueled by today’s innovation, we’ve moved beyond the mentality of gathering, analyzing, and reporting data to collecting, exploring, and sharing information —rather than simply rendering data visually we are focused on using these mechanisms to engage, communicate, inspire, and make data memorable."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"The ability to stir emotion is the secret ingredient of visual data storytelling, and what sets it apart from the aforementioned static visual data renderings. As we’ll explore in later chapters, emotional appeal isn’t enough to complete a meaningful visual data story. Like any good tale, a data story requires an anchor, or a goal—be it a reveal, a call to action, or an underlying message—to pass to its audience. This idea isn’t unique to data storytelling by any means, but a construct applied to all varieties of stories. When a story imprints on our memory, it requires emotion plus a willingness to act on that emotion. Instead of talking about the power of visual data stories, let’s see them in action. As we do, we’ll be looking for the following key takeaways:  Sometimes the only way to see the story in data is visually. A good story should meet its goals—and it should be actionable. A story should change, challenge, or confirm the way you think."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"The Classic V isualization Example One of the core tenants of a visual data story is that it uses different forms of data visualization—charts, graphs, infographics, and so on—to bring data to life. Perhaps one of the most archetypal examples of the power of data visualization to help people see and understand data in ways they never would by looking at rows and columns of raw black and white data comes from Anscombe’s Quartet (see Figure 2.3). Constructed in 1973 by statistician Francis Anscombe, these four datasets appear identical when compared by their summary statistics. If you review the table, you will notice that each dataset has the same mean of both X and Y, the same standard deviation, the same correlation, and the same linear regression equation."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"Anscombe’s example might be classic in terms of putting some support behind visual horsepower, but it only brushes the tip of the iceberg in terms of visual data storytelling. Although we might not yet have everything we need to tell a story, we can start to see that the sets are not so similar as they might appear, and there is something worth talking about in these datasets. We know there is a story there, and we know we need to visualize it to see it, but we are still left wanting. This isn’t quite a visual data story, but it’s definitely a first step. Figure 2.4 Anscombe’s Quartet, visualized. Story Takeaway Sometimes the only way to see the story in data is visually. Using Small Personal Data for Big Stories When it comes to telling a story, no one knows how to do it better than Hollywood—except maybe networks like Netflix and AMC that are using massive amounts of consumer-generated data as recipes to create new content."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"Figure 2.6 Chelsea Carlson’s Netflix data visualized. note See more of Chelsea’s Netflix data story at https://www.umbel.com/blog/data-visualization/netflix- chill-little-data-experiment-understanding-my-own- taste-tv/. As a visual storyteller, Chelsea worked through visual discovery and a variety of graph types that included scatter plots, packed bubble charts, timelines, and even pie charts to build her data story. She also integrated expressive visual elements—particularly size and color—to provide visual cues to assign meaning to the visualization and highlight certain insights. As a result, Chelsea was able to come away with a rich visual data story encapsulated within a series of very deliberately crafted visualizations. There are several interesting story points to pick out within this visualization— including a strong bias for costume dramas and shows cut short—and you can explore them for yourself in the URL included. However, perhaps the most salient point is that through this story Chelsea can take action on the goals she set for this visual story. She can clearly see her tastes and preferences, and when she goes scrolling through Netflix for her next binge-worthy show, she’ll know to look for a female- led costume drama with a genre-bending storyline."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"A good visualization—the building blocks of a visual data story—reduces time to insight and leverages our brain’s pre-attentive features to shave time as low as possible. Let’s take a look at the pre-attentive feature known as perceptual pop-out. Perceptual pop-out is the use of color as a beacon to pre-attentively detect items of importance within visualization. The shape, size, or color of the item here is less important than its ability to “pop out” of a display."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"Yet, some people argue that only two true seasons exist— summer and winter—and they’re using a form of visual data storytelling (and a good heaping of rationality) to prove their point. My favorite of these comes from artificial intelligence researcher Nate Soares’ blog, Minding Our Way. The item up for debate in this story is a simple one: Is it fair to qualify “waxing summer” (also known as spring) and “waning summer”” (also known as autumn) as full seasons? Sure, it’s familiar and if you live in the northern hemisphere you can likely distinguish the seasons according to their observable natural phenomena—such as their colorful transitions— flowers blooming or leaves changing color—rather than their actual astronomical dates (and this doesn’t even begin to open2 the conversation on astronomical versus meteorological dates of change)."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"However, whether or not you agree with Nate and me (and others!) on the number of qualifying seasons that occur over the course of one year, the preceding two graphs represent a powerful data story—and they don’t even require the type of “hard data” (rows and columns of numbers) that we would typically expect. This shows us—quite literally—that to tell a great story doesn’t necessarily require a ton of data. It just requires a few points, a goal, and the creativity to visualize it for your audience in a way that affects their opinion. Story Takeaway A story should change, challenge, or confirm the way you think."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"In fact, numerous examples of this “once and done” effect exist in more modern visual data stories, too. These one-hit wonders are an expected consequence of good stories. Sometimes we only need to tell them once—no sequels necessary. Story Takeaway Stories have an inherent amount of entropy, and some we tell only once."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"Stories Outside of the Box Thus far we’ve looked at some of the most classic examples of visual data stories to those more modern. We’ve even looked at visual data storytelling without data in the classic sense. Now, let’s finish our tour of the power of visual data storytelling with one of the most quintessential instances on the books: Nigel Holmes’ “Monstrous Costs” (see Figure 2.12). Figure 2.12 Nigel Holmes’ Monstrous Costs. This hand-drawn illustration does exactly what a visual data story is supposed to do: It transforms boring data into something alive. At its core, this data visualization is little more than a bar chart that shows rising costs on political campaign expenditures, but it’s the storytelling detail that gives it the flair that has made it such a powerful example."

You’ll learn about exploratory and explanatory analysis and strategies for successful storytelling, including narrative flow, considerations for spoken versus written narratives that support visuals, and structures that can support your stories for maximum impact. You will also explore helpful techniques in Tableau that guide you to crafting effective data narrative structure.

B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"Just as communication begins before you ever start building your first data visualization, like any good story, a visual data story requires context—a setting, a plot, a need—before you can begin to communicate. Discovering this context is part of the storytelling process. This chapter focuses on helping you understand the importance of context in data visualization and visual storytelling, how to ask the right questions in analysis that will help you begin to build out your story framework, and how to let context drive the story as you share it with your audience. The context of a data story is made up of four ingredients: Context of data Context of structure Context of audience Context of presentation context caution There’s more to context than just the data. Context can also be created by the storyteller or by the audience, based on knowledge, biases, and expectations. A successful storyteller needs to learn how to anticipate these issues. A good way to ensure your context works for you rather than against you is to ask and then answer a series of logically thought out and connected questions about the project, the data, and the audience."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"The answers to these questions provide a framework for your data story. CONTEXT IN ACTION To quote football consulting company 21 Club, without context [in analytics] data is “meaningless, irrelevant, and even dangerous.” This might sound aggressive, but in practice, it’s an understatement. Without context we can’t answer any of the pivotal journalistic questions—who, what, where, when, why, and how—that provide pertinent details to help us get to the bottom of any big question. In fact, we can’t do much beyond just make good guesses."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"Ultimately, we use data stories to drive decision- making, and nothing paves the way for bad decisions like a lack of good information. Rather than me just writing about the importance of context in data storytelling, let’s take a quick look at a fun example of a story where context makes all the difference. I use this practice in the dissection of data stories throughout this book. Harry Potter: Hero or Menace? In June 2017, Harry Potter and JK Rowling’s world of wizards celebrated its 20 anniversary. By now, most of us are familiar with The Boy Who Lived."

To prevent this, “normalize” your data with a calculated field. EXPLORATORY VERSUS EXPLANATORY ANALYSIS Before moving on to looking at storytelling techniques and story structures, we need to draw a distinction between exploratory and explanatory analysis, and how these contribute to storytelling."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"It is common for people to present exploratory graphics as part of their data story—after all, the discovery process can be an undertaking and we can be eager to show all of our hard work or display every detail we’ve found! However, the inevitable result is that this adds bulk to what should be a streamlined, focused story and muddies the message for the audience. In addition to telling a story, data storytellers must also act as their own editors. This requires trimming unnecessary content away so that the core of the data story remains unencumbered and intact. The following sections cover techniques to help achieve this. recommended reading For more on visual data discovery and working through exploratory analysis, read my book, The Visual Imperative.

Figure 4.5 A selection of filtering options in Tableau."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"STRUCTURING STORIES Like traditional stories, data stories have shape—and not just bars and bubbles!—or “structure.” Story structure plays an important role in developing a story’s context, and can be broken down into two parts:  Part One: Story Plot  Part Two: Story Genre Story Plot The events of a story (or the main part of a story) are its plot (this is also called its storyline). These events generally relate to each other in a pattern or a sequence, and the storyteller (or author) is responsible for arranging these actions in a meaningful way to shape the story. Like other forms of storytelling, the plot of a data story can be organized into a linear sequence (see Figure 4.6) or not—not all data stories are told in order; however, they all have one thing in common: They must be true. Data stories are not the place to practice fiction. Figure 4.6 The basic plot diagram. note The plot diagram is an organizational tool to help map events in a story. Its familiar triangle shape (representing the beginning, middle, and end of a story) was described by Aristotle and later modified by Gustav Freytag who added rising and falling action. Though designed for traditional stories, data stories can be built using this same framework. For the purposes of data storytelling, there are eight basic “plots” to help shape your visual data story (see Figure 4.7). Can you identify the plot used in the Harry Potter example (Hint: We were telling a story of aggressive acts over the series)? Change over time—See a visual history as told through a simple metric or trend Drill down—Start big, and get more and more granular to find meaning Zoom out—Reverse the particular, from the individual to a larger group Contrast—The “this” or “that” Spread—Help people see the light and the dark, or reach of data (disbursement) Intersections—Things that cross over, or progress (“less than” to “more than”) Factors—Things that work together to build up to a higher-level effect Outliers—Powerful way to show something outside the realm of normal Story Genre The other half of story structure is its genre. Like the diversity in plot, there is more than one genre to choose from."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,narrative visualization,"Figure 4.7 Genres of Narrative Visualization by Segel and Heer. In Tableau, you can use dashboards and story points to each of these genres, and Chapter 7, “Preparing Data for Storytelling,” explores how to build them. For now, keep in mind that data stories are most effective when they have constrained interaction at various checkpoints and allow the user to explore and engage with the story without veering too far away from the intended narrative. Stories unfold, and each visualization should highlight one story point at a time (whether within the same visualizations or within multiple) as storytellers layer points to build a complete data narrative.3 AUDIENCE ANALYSIS FOR STORYTELLING A successful data storyteller has to be a master of their craft, able to meld the worlds of data visualization and storytelling together into a cohesive whole. However, the story is only half of the equation. A story is a piece of communication, and like every communication, stories are part of a two-way dialogue between the sender (you) and the receiver (your audience). If the story gets interrupted or otherwise lost in translation, you’ve lost the ability to communicate and will likely fail."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"Remember, visual data storytelling is fact, not fiction, and as such involves a requisite degree of research as you move through visual analysis. As you practice molding yourself into a thoughtful questioner, however, you can use the some of the same journalistic questions that help to parse out the correct context for a story —particularly who, what, why, and how—to make sure you build a presentation that’s going to resonate with your audience and give them the information they need to take action. Let’s look more closely at these. Who Be specific about your audience."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"Be sure to have a solid alignment of ideas between what questions can be answered with your data and what insight or information your audience needs or wants; otherwise, your data story will fall flat, unable to satisfy audience expectations. Why Every good story should prompt an action, whether you are building a story intended to help your audience to make a decision; to cause them to change their opinion; or otherwise to convince, persuade, or educate. Ultimately, you should be crystal clear on what your goal is with the story, and why your audience should care about what you are saying. This helps to both ensure your story is meaningful and necessary, and to give you a clear target of how to build logical arguments toward a salient end goal."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"Although there are many facets to explore in this step, one of the most constructive is to understand the differences between data stories delivered as narrated, live versions or those that are non-narrated or otherwise “static” presentations. Narrated Narrated storytelling presentations are those that are delivered live—whether in person or virtually—where the storyteller has the ability to narrate the presentation and guide the experience. In this mode, the storyteller has full control of the narrative and is able to direct the audience’s attention to points of interest and facilitate transitions between story points, explaining any potential areas of ambiguity, or likewise, emphasize or soften points as needed. In addition to the ability to direct the audience, live presenters also have an obligation to be sensitive to the audience and respond to their needs."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"That way, if you need to dive into detail or add an embellishing point to your story, you can introduce it without adding junk into your presentation and interfering with the flow of your data story. Non-Narrated On the other hand, non-narrated storytelling presentations are those that are delivered without the benefit of a storyteller to guide the experience, such as reports or emails or even dashboards. In any of these instances, the storyteller relinquishes control of the audience’s experience and relies on the puts it in the hands of the tool used to distribute the information. To ensure the integrity of the visuals and the story, a highly curated and detailed view of the information is necessary."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"TIPS FOR SUCCESS IN PRESENTATIONS Telling data stories through a live presentation is as much an art as building the story itself. This means that storytellers must, in addition to their skills in data analysis and visualization, be skilled presenters, equipped with the capability to guide the audience through the story and facilitate a shared experience. It’s a known fact that public speaking in any form isn’t a concept that excites many people. In fact, in a statistic made humorous by comedian Jerry Seinfeld, according to most studies, people’s number one fear is of public speaking."

We must discuss many important elements as we dissect the visual properties of visualization and the best ways to capitalize on them. The steps you take to format your analysis and presentation are critically important as they can make or break the visual appeal and effectiveness of any visualization.

You will leverage the lessons learned thus far in the text as you work through preparing data for analysis, connecting to data, and beginning to visually explore it in Tableau. This chapter walks you through this process, from exporting raw data from survey platforms in order to discuss some important data preparation steps that matter in Tableau, through manually preparing it in Excel and using Tableau 10 and to get data just where it needs to begin building a compelling visual data story. Knowing the basics of visual data storytelling from context, to charts, to curation, better prepares you to begin crafting a compelling data narrative to deliver to your intended audience and make an impact. However, before you can start working with real data in Tableau, you need to be sure it is in the right shape for analysis. Most, if not all, data needs a little bit of work before it’s ready to become a story. We’ll work through this process using messy survey data, a common experience for data storytellers. note Follow along with these steps by downloading the raw survey data exports from www.visualdatastorytelling.com.

This chapter covers how to build a sequence of data visualizations, reviews how to build dashboards and organize them as well as individual visualizations in story points, and discusses how to make use of some of Tableau’s storytelling features."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"In an August 2017 episode of “The Nerdist” podcast, celebrated American astrophysicist—and phenomenal data storyteller—Neil DeGrasse Tyson, spoke of the importance of learning how to process and understand today’s waterhose of information, commenting, “[we need to understand] how to turn data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom.” In my opinion, this is exactly what we are doing when we build visual data stories. This chapter explores storytelling as a process, considering mechanisms available in Tableau for building and delivering your complete story and the steps you should take to build the appropriate framework for your narrative. You will apply what you’ve learned in subsequent chapters to building a story frame by frame, from curating visuals to storyboarding the visual narrative, and completing a compelling, presentation- ready story to deliver to your audience based on a dataset explored throughout this book.

B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"UNDERSTANDING STORIES IN TABLEAU Earlier chapters distilled the difference between exploratory and explanatory visualizations, and the obligation of visual data storytellers to focus on building and sharing explanatory visualizations that support the story. Like events in any narrative, visualizations should compound on each other and lead the audience through a series of events, insights, or other information that allows them to reach the goal you have decided on upfront. Building stories in Tableau is comprised of three primary mechanisms; the following sections provide a quick review. best practice Although all three of these mechanisms can support great visual data stories, be strategic in how you use them. Be aware of the impact of sizing, layout, and positioning, and make sure the view you’ve curated on your screen is consistent with your audience’s. The Device Preview functionality in Tableau supports this practice. Individual V isualizations (Sheets) Sometimes one visual is all you need, particularly if it is layered with rich tooltips or annotations."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"THE STORYBOARDING PROCESS Like all aspects of data visualization, crafting a perfect visual data story is a process of ongoing iteration and refinement. Luckily, crafting a data story is much like crafting any other narrative, and after taking the time to clean and explore your data, you can take advantage of a rather linear process to build a complete visual data story (see Figure 8.9). Figure 8.9 This linear process can help you craft the best visual data narrative. Planning Y our Story’ s Purpose Whichever mechanism you are using, as you begin planning your story, taking some time to reflect on the purpose of the story and the narrative you are attempting to share with your captivated audience is critical. Defining this purpose is the most important step of the planning stage in the storytelling."

Your story will, when complete, tie together all of these into a cohesive whole."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"Although many different types of narrative structures exist to consider, the one I have found most effective for consistently telling compelling and meaningful visual data stories regardless of the type of story is the three-act structure. Let’s review how this structure functions:  Act One—The Setup (or, the Exposition): This is where you, as the narrator, lay the groundwork for your story. It’s where you explain the purpose, introduce the plot, establish the characters and their relationships, and finish with your dramatic question or inciting incident. This is the catalyst; it’s the type of story you are telling."

B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"CHAPTER 10 CLOSING THOUGHTS We’ve covered a lot of ground in this book—from understanding the value of visual data storytelling to practicing how to build visual data stories using basic and selected advanced charts and graphs in Tableau. The lessons in this book are a huge step in the right direction, but still only the first step. Becoming a seasoned visual data storyteller takes time. The best visual data storytellers recognize that learning how to apply fundamental data visualization best practices and tell meaningful, effective stories is a skill learned over time with practice, experience, and a good, realistic dose of trial and error. These practices are ever-evolving areas, spurred onward with new technologies and inspiring new creatives who have the courage and curiosity to experiment with new approaches and new ideas. We then, as visual data explorers and storytellers, need to commit to continuous learning, both with visualization and with tools, including Tableau, as they introduce new capabilities that facilitate deeper visual analysis. As Neil DeGrasse Tyson says, “as the area of your knowledge grows, so too does the perimeter of your ignorance.” We never know everything, we can only keep learning and trying to know more."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"It also serves as a resource kit for life beyond the book by providing checklists of best practices and practical suggestions for continuing to master data storytelling, as well as discusses additional resources available to support the text. FIVE STEPS TO VISUAL DATA STORYTELLING In his book, Beautiful Data, Yau noted that today’s visual data stories are “Something in-between the textbook and the novel.” In a similar sentiment, a 2010 article in The Economist asserted that today’s visual narratives “meld the skills of computer science, statistics, artistic design, and storytelling.” Here are five steps to guide you as you work to build a perfect data story. Step 1. Find Data That Supports Your Story The first step in telling a data narrative is to find or collect data that supports the story you want to tell. The storytelling process is, in many ways, more similar to the scientific process than to any literary one."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"Start by stripping out unnecessary information and design the data story in a way that leaves the audience with a single, very potent, message. Focus on the most powerful elements; however, understand that these aren’t always the most obvious trends or elements. And remember: there is not always one truth in data, and this is where context becomes a critical element of a data story. Step 4. Beware the False Reveal A false reveal can be a dangerous thing. It can incite the audience to draw the wrong conclusions or take an incorrect action."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"As a visual data documentary, data stories should be engaging and entertaining, but should focus foremost on sharing truth. Whether we do it intentionally or inadvertently, we can force the data to tell the story we want it to, even if it’s the wrong— or inaccurate—one. With visual narratives, we are tasked not only with telling a story, but also with making it interesting, engaging, and inspiring storytelling. But data stories aren’t works of fiction. Think of a visual story as a documentary: a nonfiction work, based on a collection of data, told in a visually compelling way. Step 5. T ell It Fast Stories have an inherent amount of entropy, and have the most potency when they are happening."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"One way to tell a data story fast is by sharing with mobile. Mobile has been a game changer for data visualization in many ways and will be even more so in the years ahead. However, mobile requires wise editing. Be aware of form factor limitations and rethink the way storytelling via mobile devices happens."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,We should not overlook the need to collaborate and engage in group critiques before publishing new visuals or presenting new data stories. Successful data visualizations should be able to be understood by their intended audience from a position of personal insight and experience—this is the ability for the visualization to tell a meaningful story. Collaboration helps ensure the visualization does tell a story—and the one the author anticipated it to tell. This need for feedback is applicable both at an organizational level and at an individual one.
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data story,"All data storytellers should user-test their visualizations and stories to ensure that the message they are working to communicate is the same one being received by its intended audience. Here are a few ways to test the usability of your visualization:  Give a mock presentation to colleagues or friends to see whether they “see” the same insights you do. Ask a member of your intended audience if she can explain the message in the visualization. Have someone get hands-on with your visualization and see whether he can navigate the filters, actions, or annotations in your visual."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data stories,"Still, feedback can be validating or constructive, and if collected consciously can help us engage audiences and perfect our data stories. The old phrase “everyone’s a critic” is well and alive in data visualization. I’ve created many that have not been as brilliant as I initially thought they were. Tableau guru Steve Wexler, in his blog Data Revelations, wrote a similar sentiment, even describing moments of anger or depression that accompany less than enthusiastic feedback about a new visualization."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"Instead of dwelling on negative feedback, use it as a way to improve your visualization, corrective learning, and new information to add into your visual data storytelling skillset for your next project. note For more on the Data Visualization Competency Center, check out the Visual Imperative or the whitepaper from Radiant Advisors, available at https://radiantadvisors.com/our-research/new-research- the-data-visualization-competency-center. ONGOING LEARNING Practice and receiving audience feedback are important ways to continuously learn and perfect your skills as a visual data storyteller. Alongside these, many additional resources, both those that accompany this text and those you can find out in the wild, are available to aid you in ongoing training and skills development. Teach Y ourself: External Resources A bevy of incredible information assets beyond this book can expand and deepen your knowledge and understanding of the concepts we approached from a pragmatic stance in this text. The following are some of the resources I recommend."
B12,Visual Data Storytelling with Tableau,1,0,data storytelling,"Here are a few of my favorites that I believe offer unique and compelling galleries of visual data storytelling in action by some of the most prominent voices in data visualization and storytelling today. Flowing Data (http://flowingdata.com): This blog, run by data visualization author and statistician, Nathan Yau, explores how we can use analysis, visualization, and exploration to understand data and ourselves. Eager Eyes (https://eagereyes.org): This blog devoted to visualization and visual communication belongs to Tableau research lead Robert Kosara, and explores what we know and what we don’t know—so we can be less wrong about visualization. The Pudding (https://pudding.cool): The Pudding is a weekly journal of visual essays produced by Polygraph (http://polygraph.cool), an “incubator for visually driven storytelling.” Using code, animation, and data visualization, these stories tackle a wide range of interesting topic matter, from insights in politics, cinema and art, and science."

If the ability to make scratches on bones is considered the first technology boon to data visualization, large advances in what is possible to achieve with data visualization can be associated with the availability of developing technologies. In broad steps, this includes the use of clay tablets in Mesopotamia, the development of paper in Egypt, Johannes Gutenberg’s printing press in 1440, Konrad Zuse’s computer in 1940, and most recently in the late 1980s when Tim Berners-Lee made the Internet widely accessible  via the World Wide Web."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"RESEARCH IN DATA VISUALIZATION: FROM  UNDERSTANDING TO EXPLORATION TO DATA STORYTELLING Early research in data visualization focused on producing static images  and quantifying the perception of different visual encodings to under - stand data visually (Card, Mackinlay, and Shneiderman 1999). The vast majority of research since then has focused on designing and imple - menting novel interfaces and interactive techniques to enable data exploration. Major advances in visual analytics and big-data initiatives have concentrated on integrating machine learning and analysis meth - ods with visual representations to enable powerful exploratory analysis and data mining (Thomas and Cook 2005). As interactive visualizations  4   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling play an increasing role in data analysis scenarios, they also started to  appear as a powerful vector for communicating information. The popu - larity of JavaScript Web technology and the availability of the D3 toolkit (Bostock, Ogievetsky, and Heer 2011) also made it possible for a wider range of people to create data visualizations. Being able to easily share interactive data visualizations on the Web also increased the democra - tization of interactive visualizations. Since the field is mature enough, it is now time to understand how these powerful interactive and dynamic data visualizations can play a role in communicating information in novel ways."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"PRACTICE IN DATA JOURNALISM: FROM COMMUNICATION  TO DATA EVIDENCE TO DATA STORYTELLING Journalism has always been about communication, finding relevant  stories and disseminating them publically, observing events, gathering information, and telling this information to the general public in a man - ner that can be understood and is both interesting and relevant (Kovach and Rosenstiel 2007). There has been an increasing onus on the qual - ity of this information, from the right to protect an information source, to increasing interest in documented evidence, as in photographs, audio recordings, and video recordings, all of which can be thought of as types of data. There has also been a growing consciousness that some of today’s most relevant stories are buried in data. This data can be quite hard to understand in its raw formats but can become much more generally accessible when visualized."

B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,storytelling with data,"FORGING NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES At the time of formulating the possibility of this book, there was little overlap and collaboration between the two major communities involved: professional journalists who are at the forefront of making data-driven stories and academic researchers who are exploring research questions in regard to the role visualization can play in storytelling with data. This gap between research and practice has been widening as novel and innovative examples and genres of storytelling with data flourish in the media quite separately from the knowledge being built by the research community. The goal of this book is to try to close this gap by bringing together the voices of leading researchers and practitioners on data-driven storytelling. The chapter topics and their content were defined by authors with repre - sentation and participation from both communities. Because of the rapid and practical advances in data-driven storytell - ing and its increasingly widespread use, we gathered several of the top practitioners from journalism and design together with visualization researchers to discuss the challenges and opportunities of data-driven communication during a Dagstuhl Seminar. Schloss Dagstuhl, * a unique  venue sponsored by the German government, is a place where computer science researchers can meet to discuss currently important research questions."

To b ring together academic and industrial researchers from the  human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, information  visualization, and visual analytics research communities, as well as storytelling experts from data journalism, design, art, and education.  2. To p repare a data-driven storytelling research agenda that includes  a definition of data-driven storytelling, to compile examples, and to provide a detailed description of research directions in this space, and to offer a motivating list of research opportunities and challenges.  3. To i nvestigate how the evaluation of data-driven stories can be done,  including via expert critique, as well as through studies of audience comprehension, engagement, biases, and visualization literacy.  4. To d iscuss the ethics of data-driven storytelling authoring, identify - ing possible sources of bias and investigating how the lie factor of static visualizations applies to different media.  5. To c ompile examples of good and bad practices in application  domains (data journalism, design, art, and education) and report on current processes and practices to create data-driven stories.  6.

Other data is less concrete in that it is derived from concrete data, for example, speed is derived from time and distance. On a continuum, data can become less and less concrete as it incorporates ideas such as love and hate and expres-sions of these ideas, such as poetry.

Every chapter provides a wealth of examples of DDSs along with different analyses that are discussed from different perspectives. This discourse can serve as an initial corpus for the rapidly expanding practice around DDSs. Thus, it offers an important resource for students at all levels but particularly for advanced undergraduate and graduate stu - dents in computer science, design, journalism, and communication."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"As data-driven storytelling is compelling in a wide range of scenarios,  we envision that practitioners and data enthusiasts from many domains will find inspiration, knowledge, and practical pointers for data-driven storytelling. For example, DDSs are compelling in enterprise scenarios where the output of data analysis (often reports and slide-based presenta - tions) and business intelligence has to be conveyed to decision makers. In education scenarios, DDSs can be an effective medium to explain com - plex concepts or to illustrate biological or physical mechanisms. Finally, in many other scenarios, from journalism to art and entertainment, DDSs can help communicate complex findings to a broad audience in an engag - ing manner."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"The chapters also point to many fundamen - tal research findings and open new research questions that can serve to inform future DDS research including such factors as leveraging design and discovering appropriate strategies for evaluation. 10   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling BOOK STRUCTURE The authors in this book have a wide range of backgrounds as researchers  and professionals in the fields of data visualization, design, perception and human-computer interaction, and data journalism. This diversity offers dif - ferent and rich perspectives on the topic, and is revealed via the multiple facets written in each chapter. This book covers topics on perceptual and cognitive foundations of data-driven storytelling  (see Chapter 2), the content  and structure of DDSs (see Chapters 3–6), various data-driven storytelling processes (see Chapters 7–10), and the evaluation of DDSs (see Chapter 11). Chapter 2:   St orytelling in the Wild: Implications for Data Storytelling This chapter lays out the perceptual and cognitive foundation of how  humans understand and perceive events, stories, data graphics, and ulti - mately visual storytelling. Creating meaningful and memorable stories based on data is challenging, a craft that brings together disparate strands  of inquiry. There is the structure and understanding of events from which stories are crafted. There is the structure of stories and related kinds of discourse, descriptions, explanations, and conversations."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Chapter 3:   Ex ploration and Explanation in Data-Driven Storytelling This chapter reflects on exploratory and explanatory aspects of DDSs. Exploratory aspects give readers freedom and control over how they expe - rience the story, while explanatory aspects provide context and interpre - tation for the reader and allow the authors to communicate a particular narrative. The authors argue that DDSs can have high amounts of both explanation and exploration. To this end, the authors view data stories through multiple dimensions. Th ey examine the flexibility and interpre - tation provided in the data stories’ view, the data they focus on, and the sequences in which the data can be viewed. Examples from DDSs are used to illustrate how differing amounts of exploration and explanation can be provided in practice. Viewing these as complementary aspects could lead to new ways of integrating exploration and explanation in DDSs. Introduction    ◾   11 Chapter 4:  Da ta-Driven Storytelling Techniques: Analysis  of a Curated Collection of Visual Stories Integrating data visualization into narrative stories has now become com - monplace."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,narrative visualization,"This chapter advances the study of narrative visualization through an analysis of a curated collection of DDSs shared on the Web. Drawing from the results of this analysis, it presents a set of techniques being employed in these examples, organized under four high-level categories that help authors tell stories in creative ways: communicating narrative and explaining data, linking separated story elements, enhancing structure and navigation, and providing con - trolled exploration. The benefits of each storytelling technique along with a number of example applications of the ideas in DDSs are discussed. Furthermore, the evolution of the field and areas for future research are outlined."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Chapter 5:   Na rrative Design Patterns for Data-Driven Storytelling This chapter introduces the concept of narrative design patterns that  aim  to facilitate the shaping of compelling DDSs. There are many different  ways storytellers can narrate the same story, depending on their inten - tions and their audience. Here, the authors define and describe a set of these narrative design patterns that can be used on their own or in com - bination to tell data stories in a myriad of ways. The authors then analyze 18 of them, and illustrate how these patterns can help storytellers think about the stories they want to tell and the best ways to narrate them. Each pattern has a specific purpose, for example, engaging the audience, evok - ing empathy, or creating flow and rhythm in the story. The authors assume storytellers already know what story they want to tell, why they want to tell it, and who they want to tell it to."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"These patterns may not only facilitate the process of creating compelling narratives, but stimulate a wider dis - cussion on techniques and practices for data-driven storytelling. Chapter 6:   Wa tches to Augmented Reality: Devices and  Gadgets for Data-Driven Storytelling This chapter discusses different device form factors and their affordances  and characteristics for different storytelling settings. A wide range of form  12   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling factors for data-driven storytelling, including not only the obvious elec - tronic “devices,” but also more diverse media such as tangible props (i.e.,  things that people can pick up and hold, gesticulate with, and so on) are considered. The latter are worth considering because they can give insights into how data storytelling might occur in futuristic mixed-reality digital environments that may be enabled by the current rapid progress in virtual and augmented reality display and interaction technologies. In addition, this discussion of devices considered not only display contents but also the possibilities for direct interaction. The chapter also presents a set of examples that use different devices in data-driven storytelling, reflecting on how to tell DDSs when using different devices and media. Chapter 7:   Fr om Analysis to Communication: Supporting  the Lifecycle of a Story This chapter describes the lifecycle of visual data stories, including the  tools and methods that authors employ to create visual stories, the pro - cesses they go through, and the major pain points they experience. The dis - cussion of current practices , as presented, is based on interviews with nine  professional data storytellers. Each of these interviews explored the par - ticipant’s experience with one past story production project. The chapter focuses on the visual data storytelling process, from conception through production, including data collection and preparation, data analysis, story development, and visual presentation. Also included is a detailed descrip - tion of the main roles and activities that storytellers engage in as they turn raw data into a visually shared story and the tools they use to support their work. Based on the example projects described by the participants, the process of story production is summarized, an overview of the tools that are in use is given, and opportunities for research and design are detailed. Chapter 8:   Or ganizing the Work of Data-Driven Visual Storytelling One of the challenges of telling compelling, effective DDSs is how a group  organizes their teams, skillsets, and workflow."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Chapter 10:   Eth ics in Data-Driven Visual Storytelling Many questions that relate to ethics arise in data-driven storytelling. Is the  sample representative, have we thought of the bias of whoever  co llected or  aggregated the data, can we extract a certain conclusion from the dataset, is it implying something the data does not cover, does the visual device, or the interaction, or the animation affect the interpretation that the   aud ience  can have of the story? These are questions that anyone that has produced or edited a data-driven visual story has, or at least should have, been con - fronted with. After introducing the reasons and implications of ethics in this book, this chapter looks at the risks, caveats, and considerations at every step of the process, from the collection/acquisition of the data to the analysis, presentation, and publication, with many points illustrated through an example of an ethical consideration."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"This chapter is intended to serve as a guide for those considering whether and how they should evaluate the sto - ries they produce or the storytelling tools or techniques that they develop. 14   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling FUTURE DIRECTIONS Many questions arise as interactive visualizations are used in situations  beyond data exploration by data experts, such as the focus in this book on communication to a broader audience. Research on the understand - ing of static images in cognitive psychology and perception may need to be extended to encompass more advanced techniques (videos and interactive applications). Visualization literacy, or the ability to extract, interpret, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an interactive data visualization, is also a crucial component in data-driven storytelling. Assessing the visualization literacy of an audience and developing techniques to better teach how to decode interactive visualizations has started to attract the attention of our research com - munity. * Still, there remains considerable exciting research that can to  be done to contribute to a well-informed society. For example, research on how visualizations can lie (Tufte 1984) or at least how they may intro - duce bias in the reader’s mind has focused on static visual representa - tions. Now, opportunities, that are perhaps essential, are developing for research on the process of understanding the effects of interactiv - ity on how interpretation emerges."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Similarly, it is crucial for advancing research in visualization to assess the role data-driven storytelling can play in easing the comprehension of messages or in increasing their memorability. Another future direction for research regards the evolution of our soci - ety in light of trends in data . Our society has entered a data-driven era in  which not only are  enormous amounts of data being generated every day,  but also growing expectations are placed on their analysis (Thomas and Cook 2005). Analyzing these massive and complex datasets is essential to making new discoveries, communicating them, and creating benefits for people."

The breakpoints between event segments are identified by large changes in the physical stream that signal changes in actions, intentions, and goals. From perceiving events to retellings of events , the spontaneous stories of  our lives that we tell our friends. Retellings embellish by adding, omit - ting, and exaggerating even important details; fortunately, many of these are discounted by listeners."

The same participant described the fine-level actions in this way: “unfolding sheet; laying it down; putting on the top end of the sheet; putting on the bottom; straightening it out.” Each new fine-action segment involved a new action on the same object."

To learn how that happens in everyday life, we asked university students to record events that they retold to their friends, family, and other acquain - tances over the course of 4  we eks (Marsh & Tversky, 2004). For each retell - ing, they wrote what had actually happened, what they had said, to whom they said it, and for what reason. They wrote whether their retelling was accurate and then whether they had omitted important details, added details that did not actually happen, or exaggerated or minimized aspects of what actually occurred."

B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data story,"The first thing a powerful data story needs is powerful data. Graphs, charts, and diagrams, like facts, often cannot stand on their own.

B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"The advent of pixels allows forging the visual-spatial and the verbal back together in flu - ent harmony, and that forging is key to effective data storytelling. Communication is structured at many levels, not only  the familiar syn - tactic, semantic, and pragmatic, but also at the more encompassing level of discourse, here referred to as genre. Genre reflects the mode of convey - ance , primarily description, explanation, or story. Many communities have  analyzed genres of discourse—linguistics, literature, rhetoric, journalism, comics, drama, filmmaking, animation, narratology, law, philosophy, soci - ology, psychology, and more (some, but far from enough, resources for psy - chology and stories: Bruner, 1987; Bower, Black, & Turner, 1979; Brewer & Lichtenstein, 1982; Mandler, 1981; Rumelhart, 1975; Trabasso, Stein, & Johnson, 1981; psychology, conversation: Clark, 1996; psychology, film: Cutting, DeLong,  & Nothelfer, 2010; Magliano, Miller, & Zwaan, 2001; Zacks,  2015; film: Bordwell  & Thompson, 2003; Brannigan, 1992; Murch, 2001; Tan,  1996;   li nguistics, discourse: Brown & Yule, 1983, Gee, 2014, Ronen, 1990,  Shiffrin, Tannen, & Hamilton, 2008; Van Dijk, 1993, 2001; linguistics, sto - ries: Chafe, 1980, 1998; computer graphics: Hullman  & Diakopoulos, 2011,  Hullman, Drucker, Riche, Lee, Fisher, & Adar, 2013; Segal & Heer, 2010; com - ics, graphic  na rratives: Eisner, 1985; McCloud, 1994; narratology: Bruner,  1987; Prince, 2003; philosophy, Currie, 2010)."

As I structure the first three forms, each  adds elements to the previous form so that they build on one another. I end the section with a discussion of literary journalism, or literary nonfiction, the genre that seems most pertinent to current nonfiction including data storytelling, a form that weaves together the discourse types rhythmically. Whether genres are pure or mixed, words or graphics, ordered or not,  every piece of discourse requires authors to select the information that is relevant, to express it felicitously, and to link the pieces into a whole. An elementary decision for authors is whether to impose an order, canoni - cal for purely verbal media, or to create interactivity, allowing readers to explore. When ordered, as in words or words and graphics embedded in a narrative, there is a beginning, middle, and end."

They took note of graphic narrative devices that introduce (overview establishing shot), direct attention (e.g., grouping, arrows), and main - tain orientation (e.g., visual anaphora, slider bar) as a narrative proceeds. Hullman and Diakopoulos (2011) survey a large number of illuminating examples that illustrate rhetorical devices adopted in data storytelling. Hullman et  al . (2013) examined the kinds and frequency of transitions  in data videos, relating them to techniques used in film. Not surprising, the most frequent transition was chronological, appropriate for descrip - tions and explanations; the second was general to specific, appropriate for descriptions. Descriptions, explanations, and stories provide mental models that help  us to understand the world: descriptions for the appearance and struc - tures of organisms, things, places, and institutions; explanations for how things, people, nations, systems operate and work; stories for all forms and interactions of humanity, emotion, ambition, and desire."

Language  is an example; language emerges in large and small communities and changes as needs and goals change (e.g., Clark, 1996; Donald, 1991). So too for commonly used visualizations, like sketch maps. This natural process of iterative trial and error can be shortcut in the laboratory to provide empirical methods to find and test design principles through a program we call the Three P’s: Production, Preference, and Performance (Kessell & Tversky, 2011; Tversky et al ., 2007)."

LOOKING FORWARD: INSIGHTS FROM COMIX Like traditional visual explanations and stories, comix present step-by-step boxes so that these are sometimes referred to as comic book explanations. Of course, comix do so much more, as shall be seen. They differ from animations in a critical way: each new frame may not be an alteration of the previous one."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"Some comix devices have already been adopted in data storytelling (e.g., Bach, Kerracher, Wim, Hall, Carpendale, Kennedy,  & Riche, 2016). Every designer will want to keep McCloud’s Understanding Comics  (1994) close at hand. It is a comic that analyzes comics, and in doing so, provides insights into storytelling and story-understanding in general, and in the conjoint use of depictions and language to do so. Also to be kept close at hand are Spiegelman’s Co-Mix  (2013), a grab-bag of insights from  one of the masters of the medium and Eisner’s Comics and Sequential Art  44   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling (2008), more insights from another master of the medium.

B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"Indeed, for visual explanations like furniture assembly, this technique seems to work well, and should work well for data storytelling. Many data stories do concern changing events over time and the designers’ goals are often to tell the stories in a straightforward way. By contrast, designers of comix stories often want drama and surprise,  which demand not telling stories in a straightforward way. Time can be drawn out by showing small changes in successive frames or chopped up into jumpy, staccato changes. McCloud (1994) discusses some of visual devices that can alter the experience of time."

So little of the world is wild. Our actions design the world,  the space around us : into rows and columns on shelves and buildings and  streets that reflect categories and hierarchies and orders ; into rooms and  buildings with themes ; into table settings and buildings with 1-1 corre - spondences and repetitions and symmetries. The actions that create the organizations, putting, ordering, lifting, turning, separating, and more, get abbreviated into gestures that communicate those actions, literally or metaphorically."

Communication first developed face-to-face, and communication in the wild uses many layers and modes simultaneously—words, prosody, gestures, actions, and props in the world. The freezing of communication into depictions in caves, on stone, in stained glass windows, and words on tablets and paper allowed preserving and disseminating knowledge, but it also led to separating the natural layers and modes and even eliminating some of them, notably prosody and gesture. Contemporary visual expla - nations, data journalism, and comix reunite depictions, graphics, and lan - guage and even prosody and gesture in rich and varied visual forms; they expand the form and enlarge our understanding with a wealth of delight - ful visual tropes."

Highly explanatory stories are often finite: they have a beginning, an end, and often a lin - ear progression.

Advancements in web-based visualization technology and the rapid adoption of data-driven documents (D3) fostered new, dynamic data-driven storytelling on the Web (Bostock et al. 2011). Authors have introduced a variety of novel narrative visualization techniques and refined existing ones while narrative visualizations have continued to grow in popularity. Some of these stories even include innovative tech - niques that are new to the visualization research community. For example, “Visualizing MBTA Data”  [9] tells the story of Boston’s public transit using  a range of interesting storytelling and visualization techniques including clever linkages between text and visualization *. We believe that the visu - alization community could benefit by learning about and adopting ideas from many of these stories."

These examples should inspire and encourage authors to continue exploring ever more creative means of telling visual data stories * Note: Throughout this text we use numbers in superscript brackets, e.g. [9] to refer to examples that  are listed in the “Stories Analyzed” references at the end of the chapter.

To have a more focused and detailed  discussion, we reviewed storytelling through Lee et  al.’s lens, excluding  those extreme “reader-driven” stories that lack an author-defined “plot” (Lee et  al. 2015). Our set of stories ranges from more conventional nar - rative visualizations, such as long articles including visualizations or data-driven videos, to more experimental examples of data-driven story - telling. The results of our analysis are 20 visual, data-driven storytelling   te chniques falling under 4 broad categories that authors use to tell their  stories (Table 4.1). In describing each of the categories, we highlight sto - ries from the data set that exemplify the category and the associated tech - niques used to achieve it. We also discuss the trends we observed across these different techniques and conclude with a discussion of research   op portunities, most importantly for the design of authoring tools for  data-driven storytelling. ANALYSIS METHOD AND PROCESS Our goal was to better understand the data-driven storytelling tech - niques that authors use in practice. To identify a corpus of data stories, we followed the methodologies used by previous literature (Segel and Heer 2010, Hullman and Diakopoulos 2011, Hullman et  al. 2013a).

We then added a selection of popular or staff-recommended stories from the Visually community. To identify the techniques existing data-driven storytelling tools support, we included highlighted examples from a number of tools’ webpages, including Tableau Story Points, Timeline JS, and Infogr.am. Finally, we supplemented this set with stories from frequent visual data journalism sources such as The New York Times , The Washington Post , The Guardian ,  Bloomberg , FiveThirtyEight , and The Economist to counterbalance stan - dard practice against the novelty effect that might be present in the “best of” and “recommended” lists. We sought to examine a broad range  of stories, and we include examples   that reflect recent developments in the field and that the community has found especially interesting. Our corpus is not comprehensive or repre - sentative of the field as a whole, so we will refrain from making specific quantitative ratios or judgments about a technique’s prevalence."

The link  between the narrative and the visualization helps the reader discern what item in the visualization the author is referencing in the text.

Rather  than having scrolling trigger any changes (“scrolljacking”) a Boston sub - way map visualization moves down to stay on screen as the reader scrolls through a timetable visualization of each train’s movement throughout a day. Because this visualization is linked with the timetable visualization (as we discussed in the “Linking Separated Story Elements” section), the reader may experience a simulated scrolljacking experience: the subway map visualization appears to be changing as the reader is scrolling when the mouse passes over the timetable visualization."

B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,narrative visualization,"Providing Controlled Exploration Unlike pure exploratory visualization, narrative visualization has been  characterized by limited reader interaction with visualizations. While studies have cast doubts on the traditional assumption that exploration inherently increases reader engagement (Boy et  al. 2015), it is still appeal - ing to add more flexible exploratory capabilities to stories. However, enabling full reader exploration in a story has risks. If the reader can  98   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling change a visualization significantly, the data displayed may no longer be  consistent with the narrative surrounding it. Furthermore, the reader may find themselves lost in the data, either from data overload or from having over-filtered. In light of this, data-driven storytelling often relies on pro - viding exploratory elements that are controlled or constrained. An interaction technique that has become common to constrain read - ers’ ability to adjust visualization components is the use of dynamic que - ries (Shneiderman 1994). At end of the story, the authors of “Addicted to  Trucks” [34] (Figure 4.4) allow the reader to change the color scheme and  grouping attribute of one visualization independently, but constrain the choices to only four options: “car/truck,” “origin,” “major brand,” and “gainers/losers.” The dynamic query portion of “Addicted to Trucks” [34]  is also an example of the embedded exploratory visualizations  tech - nique. This technique is used when the authors have included a more exploratory visualization, often defined by a large amount of user inter - action, within the story. “Gay Rights in the US, State by State” [22] also  utilizes the technique, including a large exploratory visualization at the top of the story and then discussing the details of the story as it progresses."

In addition, it is not unusual that stories would use multiple techniques within a category. For example, “Strong Hiring Still Isn’t Bringing Pay Raises” [14] includes both traditional  long-form textual narrative and brief audio narration.

The main challenge we face is how to support authors to find the right balance between full explo - ration systems and static stories. One possible solution is to make it easier for authors to configure the degree of possible interaction with underlying data. Some of this can be achieved from supporting event-driven interac - tion, e.g., Ellipsis (Satyanarayan and Heer 2014) and some can be achieved  from tools for mapping dynamic query widgets to elements of a story."

However, annotation is far from a “solved problem.” There are three  properties of any annotation: the content (e.g., text or value), the location, and the time (for the annotation to appear and disappear)."

Many of the most innovative stories in our collection employ scrolling in creative ways. However, only casual discussions of the merits of using scrolling as a navigational structure have been written (Bostock 2014).

To identify the tech - niques that data-storytellers use, we analyzed a collection of data-driven stories, focusing on the specific techniques used in author-constructed, data-driven storytelling. We identified 20 visual storytelling techniques organized into four categories: communicating narrative and explaining data, linking separated story elements, enhancing structure and naviga - tion, and providing controlled exploration. Through identifying tech - niques to be incorporated into stories, this work informs the design of future tools that enable storytellers to effectively create data-driven pieces. We also reflected on these findings and enumerated a number of possibili - ties for future research."

Here we are guided by the definitions in Gerard Genette’s The Narrative Discourse [1], Bruner’s The Actual Mind [2], and  which are summarized in the Media Student’s Book [3].

Thus, a narrative gives shape to the unfolding events in a story, with the  goal of making them clear and compelling to an audience. The narrative can be linear, e.g., representing the actual order of events (the story) chron - ologically; or nonlinear, e.g., circular, where the beginning and end mirror themselves. Nonlinear storytelling has been used in highly acclaimed mov - ies, such as Pulp Fiction and Memento , where the narration either jumps  between scenes ( Pulp Fiction ), or tells the story backwards ( Memento , fol- lowing the main character gradually remembering his personal past) [4] ."

Patterns for argumentation serve the intent of persuading and convincing audiences. The classical devices of rhetoric involve logos (reason, word), ethos   (character, ideal), and pathos  (experience, emotion). Though we believe  the ultimate goal of data-driven storytelling is to communicate truth (most closely to logos), there are traces of both pathos (see the “Patterns for Empathy and Emotion” section), and ethos in every story, which help connect the narrator with the audience. One very common pattern of argumentation is compare  (Figure 5.3). The narrator presents two or more data sets, and draws respective conclu - sions from them.

Some of the previously mentioned patterns, e.g., gradual reveal  or  slowing down , can contribute to emotional responses like surprise or the  feeling of being lost.

B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"CONCLUSIONS This chapter introduced narrative patterns for data-driven storytelling. We described and illustrated a core collection of 18 patterns with   exa mples,  discussed relations between patterns, and gave scenarios on their usage. We are only at the very beginning of understanding how data-driven  storytelling works and how narrative patterns can benefit the commu - nication of a message. Beyond creating data-driven stories, we hope that narrative patterns will help authors think more broadly about data-driven storytelling. For example, the discussion of what can be called data-driven storytelling is far from settled (hence, the motivation for this book), and the transition from explanations based on illustrations and graphics towards data-driven argumentations is gradually sinking in. Also, we do not think (all) narrative patterns are limited to data-driven storytelling. Rather, we got inspiration from common storytelling mediums and looked for com - mon patterns across the domains, i.e., where the rather novel medium of data-driven stories is related to the classical mediums. We also do not see narrative patterns bound to a specific technical medium such as videos, static or interactive graphics, interactive presentations, games, news arti - cles, etc. We hope that the narrative patterns presented here can contrib - ute to the discussion on what data-driven storytelling is, what its mediums are, and what are good or bad practices. Many questions remain to be answered. What are the specific rules a  specific narrative pattern should adopt or implement? Which patterns go  130   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling well with each other and which exclude each other? Though we do not aim  to restrict and over-quantify narrative patterns, such questions can serve to establish a common ground to create effective stories. Other questions remain on which patterns are suitable for which audi - ence and how particular patterns apply to specific media; how does the presentation medium change the implementation of the narrative pattern? This is closely related to the specific techniques that are used in the imple-mentation of a narrative pattern, and how those are related to the presen - tation medium, e.g., animation, interactive highlighting, multiple choice questions, interactive simulations, etc."

The differ - ent form factors offer different affordances for data storytelling, affecting their suitability to the different data storytelling settings (Lee et al., 2015; see Chapter 7 , entitled “From Analysis to Communication Supporting  the Lifecycle of a Story”). For example, wall displays are well-suited for synchronous colocated presentations (i.e., where the presenter and audi - ence are together at the same time, in the same room), while wristwatches and virtual reality headsets work better for personal consumption of pre-authored data stories. The title of this chapter includes “Devices and Gadgets” to avoid confusion with the other kind of “storytelling devices” (i.e., narrative techniques; see Chapter 4 , entitled “Data-Driven Storytelling  Techniques: Analysis of a Curated Collection of Visual Stories”). In this chapter, we discuss a list of different device form factors as well  as their affordances and characteristics for different storytelling settings. We consider a fairly wide range of form factors for data-driven storytell - ing, including not only the obvious electronic “devices,” but also more diverse media such as tangible props (i.e., things that people can pick up and hold, gesticulate with, and so on). The latter are worth considering because they can give insights into how data storytelling might occur in futuristic mixed-reality digital environments that may be enabled by the current rapid progress in virtual reality (VR) and augmented   re ality (AR)  display and interaction technologies. In addition, the devices we consider not only display content but also offer direct interaction in most cases. We also present a set of examples that use different devices for data-driven   st orytelling, reflecting on how the technology enables or otherwise influ - ences storytelling. We conclude this chapter with a discussion of the evolution of display and interaction device technology, and how it might affect future data-driven storytelling capabilities. Note that we do not consider the story creation (i.e., authoring) experi - ence because it seems likely that, for the foreseeable future, creation of engag - ing visual data-driven stories will require powerful desktop platforms. We focus on the story presentation and consumption experiences, specifically considering the following two scenarios. First, a presenter gives a live (i.e., synchronous) presentation to the audience."

For both cases, the  audience may be different sizes, from one person to a group of people. CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT DEVICES In this section, we delineate a set of dimensions to better characterize the affordances of different devices. We propose six dimensions: live presen - tation capability, perception size, level of immersion, portability, level of isolation, and haptic feedback (Table 6.1)."

That is, traditional interaction through  a mouse and keyboard is not really sharable. However, these devices do support a small, passive audience of onlookers. Perception size  refers to the size of the display relative to the viewer’s  field of view at the usual viewing distance."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data stories,"Thus, a laptop can at least be moved but probably cannot be used to consume data stories while walking a dog. As the name implies, the level of isolation  captures the degree from which  the viewer is isolated from the real-world environment mainly due to the device. For example, VR headsets offer a high level of isolation while AR headsets deliver a low level of isolation. Lastly, haptic feedback can have a  significant impact on the audience’s consumption experience, stimulating their tactile sensation."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"However, to the best of  our knowledge, there is no holistic survey on the topic of accessibility for visualization or data-driven storytelling though there is a clear need for further research in this area. EXAMPLES OF PRACTICES BY DEVICES Watches come with a very small screen, accommodating a private con - sumption. They are usually appropriate for single-sentence stories, provid - ing linear narration (Figure 6.1). Word-scale visualizations, a more-general version of sparklines—small, word-sized data graphics that allow meta-information to be visually presented in-line with document text (Goffin et al., 2014)—can be embedded within the story for watches."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data stories,"We argue that it is more likely for people to encounter and consume data stories (such as those in Figures 6.1 and 6.2) in this small-screen form factor than other types of devices. It is also worth noting that, while we consider the live presentation capability  FIGURE 6.1  Due to a small screen size, stories on watches are usually presented  with a single image or sentence (www.theguardian.com). 142   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling of the devices in Table 6.1 and in the following discussion, the default  data-story consumption modality for these small-screen devices (includ - ing watches and tablets) is still asynchronous (i.e., off-line). While not ideal for synchronous presentation (i.e., the perception size  is limited), it is still possible to use phones with a small audience (one or two people). Even though linear narration is the default due to just enough screen real estate combined with simple touch interaction, it is possible to offer more sophisticated navigation (Figure 6.2) . Thus, the audience may  have more commitment and engagement to the story."

In addition, devices that can track a person’s entire body postures and  gestures , such as the Microsoft Kinect, offer a presenter more engaging  presentations on wall displays through the use of proxemics  (Jakobsen  et al., 2013). That is, when the system is aware of the presenter’s precise  position (and proximity) relative to the display, it can alter the data display as desired, for example, to show greater detail for a feature that the pre - senter is pointing to. VR headsets afford full immersion, isolating the audience from the real- world environment including other people."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"AR devices offer exciting possibilities for future data storytelling sce - narios. For example, Hans Rosling reveals the story of the world’s past, present, and future development using “simulated” AR animation in a video presentation (Figure 6.6). This is simulated AR in that the aug - mented visuals have been carefully added to the video recording by ani - mators, supporting asynchronous yet broad consumption. However, in the future, such an interesting and creative presentation might be possible in a live (i.e., synchronous) setting where the audience members each have an AR headset that shows the data visuals hanging in space in front of the  FIGURE 6.5  Telling a story about historical air traffic data in VR."

Visually induced motion sickness can occur when the audience views drastic visual representations of self-motion or when detectable lags are present between head movements and presentations in a head-mounted display (HMD) (Hettinger and Riccio, 1992). However, rapid improvements in tracking and rendering technologies have reduced such latencies to the point where motion sickness is becoming much less of an issue (Carmack, 2013). Now that cardboard devices—costing just a few dollars—can turn a phone into a VR headset (e.g., Google Cardboard), VR is definitely a technology worth considering for delivering engaging data-stories to a mass audience."

As stated in the introduction, we assumed that currently traditional personal computer devices are the main platform for such authoring. This is partly because a mouse and key - board are still the preferred way to work with complex media-authoring software. But, another major factor is that smaller devices still have lim - ited processing power in terms of onboard memory, graphics processing capability, and central processing unit (CPU) speed."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"CONCLUSION Over the decades we have seen the display devices available for compu - tational data-driven storytelling both shrink to fit into a watch face and grow to cover walls while HMDs offering VR and AR experiences are now commodity devices. In parallel, we have witnessed the introduction of novel interaction techniques from touch to body tracking. These can be leveraged to engage the consumer through reactive data-driven story - telling, or by promoting the feeling of “being there” or being present. To provide better presentation and consumption experiences, it is important to understand the affordances and characteristics (both pros and cons) of different devices."

Journalists, illustrators, developers, and analysts often work in mixed teams to develop new and richer reader experiences by introducing novel storytelling techniques and refining existing ones. A broad range of skills, disciplines, tools, and tech - nologies comes together to support the creation of these visual-data stories. Yet there is limited research that describes the various tools and meth - ods that authors employ to create visual data stories, the processes they go through, and the major pain points they experience. In this chapter, we dis - cuss the current practices as expressed by data storytellers we interviewed, give an overview of the tools that are in use, and detail opportunities for research and design. We focus on the visual data storytelling process, from conception through production, including data collection and prepara - tion, data analysis, story development, and visual presentation. We are particularly concerned with the tools and practices that are involved in constructing a story that is driven or accompanied by data visualization. In discussing a high-level overview of storytelling and outlining the  research opportunities, Kosara and Mackinlay (2013) use a working model for how stories are constructed based on how journalists work. More recently, Lee et al. proposed a visual data storytelling process derived from the existing models in the data journalism literature.

They provide a detailed description of the main roles and activities that sto - rytellers engage in as they turn raw data into a visually shared story. We build on Lee et al.’s model, and propose a revised process, grounded in interviews with professionals who create visual data stories. As in Lee et al.’s work, we discuss the main activities, resulting artifacts, as well as roles that are involved in the storytelling process. UNDERSTANDING CURRENT PRACTICES:  INTERVIEWS WITH DATA STORYTELLERS While storytelling has gained substantial interest in data visualization  research (Segel and Heer 2010, Hullman and Diakopoulos 2011, Hullman et al. 2013b, Kosara and Mackinlay 2013, Lee et  al. 2015, Stolper et  al.  2016), we are specifically interested in approaches and tools currently used in practice. We conducted interviews with nine visual data storytellers to better understand the process that they undergo to construct visual stories with data. In this section, we describe our methodology for eliciting and analyzing feedback from these professionals, and discuss major insights gained from our qualitative analysis. Methodology We interviewed nine professionals (Table 7.1) including journalists,  designers, and researchers who had experience in authoring visual data stories, as a single author, as part of a collaborative team, or both. We elicited responses from each professional individually using a semistruc - tured interview protocol (Figure 7.1). Our interviews focused on the pro - cess they undergo to create a visual data story, from the ideation phase, to the execution, to the publication, and beyond. We also inquired about the different roles involved in the creative process as well as the tools a team of storytellers use to perform data analysis, design visualizations, build the narrative, document the process, and collaborate around a visual data story project. To better capture the entire process from end to end, we asked the interviewees to pick a concrete example of a project that they felt would be interesting to share. We asked them to choose any project they considered worth discussing; for example, it could be a typical project, or conversely, could be a unique project that they were particularly proud of. We asked the interviewees to describe the process with that particu - lar example in mind, but encouraged them to deviate from that instance  154   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling whenever relevant, to comment on differences in the authoring process  for other projects or atypical activities. Interviews lasted between 30 –90  minutes overall; no time constraint was imposed. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Though they were  semistructured to guarantee that each interview covered all aspects we were interested in, the interviews were more like informal discussions around a particular data story project than scheduled around a predefined list of questions. We therefore collected rich, qualitative information that we coded using a thematic analysis (Boyatzis 1998). Three of the chapter authors thoroughly read through all of the transcripts, noted all interest - ing comments and events, and roughly organized this data in categories. Here, we report the most notable insights that emerged from our analysis, starting first with an overview of the storytelling process."

Even when the main story outcome is known a priori, this data analysis process is still necessary to verify the story’s claims and identify the most pertinent data fragments to get a point across through a visual story. Moritz Stefaner, who worked on the redesign of a figure from a study done by researchers (Figure 7.4), insisted that even though “ the data analysis was done [...] the first step is  always understanding the material [i.e.,] the completeness, distribution, and also the texture of the data. ” Furthermore, the designer had to do a  (b)(a) FIGURE 7.3  Illustration of the exploring data phase in a newsroom."

B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"Cristina Elmer reported a similar issue when she “ found data points that weren’t quite clean ” in  the nursing homes data set her team obtained from a professional agency, further commenting that “ this is a regular data problem that you have with  corrupt data .” Like Stefan Wehrmeyer, she too phoned nursing homes to  find out what corrections to apply; she did not consider this out of the ordinary, stating that the experience was “ usual stuff ” when working on  data storytelling. The data exploration phase is often associated with sketching, plot - ting, and charting, and therefore is often intermingled with exploration of visual externalizations of the data, though the specification of visual representations is not necessarily set at this stage. Making a story consists of selecting and assembling the identified data  excerpts in a sequence that forms a coherent and compelling narrative (Figure 7.7). Starting with a collection of key story points and data excerpts resulting from the data exploration phase, the storytellers still have “ to  break [this information] down, and prioritize, and bring it into sequence, ”  164   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling as Moritz Stefaner described. Our interviews confirmed that the sequence  plays a critical role in a story. The main activities in this phase include set - ting the stage, ordering, establishing logical connections and important context, developing flow, formulating a message, and creating the arc and denouement of the storyline or plot. These activities often require multiple iterations, making it necessary to go back to the data exploration phase to gather not only more excerpts but also more data (Gratzl et al. 2016)."

B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Roles With the diverse activities comprising the process of creating a visual  data story, there are also various roles and skill sets distributed among  168   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling the coauthors such as artists, designers, and developers ( see Chapter  8,  entitled “Organizing the Work of Data-Driven Visual Storytelling ,” for  more details on how these roles and skill sets are often constituted into  functioning teams). The data collector  gathers the data and makes it  usable through a data wrangling process. The data analyst  examines and  explores the data to identify meaningful insights or excerpts. A scripter   builds the overall plot using these excerpts."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data story,"In addition, in some cases, the producer  (or  client) initiates the creation of a visual data story by hiring storytellers. Many of these roles (data analyst, scripter, editor, and presenter) were also identified in related work (Lee et al. 2015). Note that roles are not synony - mous with individuals: each contributor may take on one or many differ - ent roles. Ulrike Köppen insisted on the interdisciplinary nature of data storytelling and argued that for the team to function well, “ everyone has  to know what the other needs for their work, ” and so each member of the  team, regardless of their role(s), “ has to know a little bit about what coding  means, what graphics means, what design means so that [one’s] knowledge can serve the others to do better work. ” Storytelling Constraints External factors can substantially influence the creation process. Lee et  al. (2015) discussed three external factors: (1) the target audience at the receiving end of the shared story (see Chapter 9 entitled “Communicating Data to an Audience”), (2) the setting in which a story is told, and (3) the medium that conveys the story. Our interviews revealed two additional important external factors that slowed down, or even hindered, the cre - ative process: time and cost constraints  and legal and ethical implications . Many of our interviewees mentioned the time pressure to deliver sto - ries, a typical constraint in journalistic circles: “ We basically have time  constraints and resource constraints because we’re doing too much at the same time ” (Stefan Wehrmeyer)."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data story,"Legal implications, e.g., copyright, as well as ethical issues can also impact the process and the resulting visual data story. For instance, Kennedy Elliot, the journalist involved in the project about deaths caused by police, said that in many occasions, they wondered, “ Do we publish this? Can we disclose that? ” (See  Chapter 10 entitled “Ethics in Data-Driven Visual Storytelling”.) TOOL LANDSCAPE The interviews revealed that a wide variety of systems, tools, and tech - nologies are used for producing visual data stories. In the following, we aim to provide an overview of the landscape. The goal is not to provide recommendations on what to use for what purpose, but to provide insights on patterns and trends. The landscape is dynamic: this overview presents tools and systems that were in use in 2016, and very probably new tools will emerge and others will lose popularity."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Companies and institutes  170   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling often have de facto standards for preferred tools, and for instance, a local  data base management system (DBMS) or content management system (CMS) can impose considerable constraints on the production of a data story. The quality level required varies: sometimes basic statistics and graphics suffice, in other cases a sophisticated analysis or careful tuning is required. In addition, the data to be shown varies, including numeric, geographic, network, and text data. For each data type, dedicated tools are available for analysis and visualization."

That makes evident that tools with a high level of abstraction, aiming to provide a complete solution and shielding users from details, often fall short, and that often one has to rely on low-level coding. Exploring data  requires functionality for data acquisition, cleaning and  conversion, analysis, and visualization. From a tooling landscape point of view, two approaches can be distinguished."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"But, for many tasks and data types, spreadsheets  176   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling fall short and more specialized tools are needed, for instance, to analyze  and visualize networks. Highly sophisticated and professional end-user tools can be costly, both  in terms of commercial costs and the effort needed to acquire a useful level of proficiency. As a reaction, simpler end-user tools are developed with a clear and crisp functionality. Some examples are infogr.am, High Charts, and DataWrapper, which support rapid development of interactive Web-based business graphics."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data stories,"As an example, Illustrator is used for final storytelling and polishing as well in the conception stage as reported by Kennedy Elliot, “So initially just Illustrator to mock things up, and pad and paper to sketch things and get ideas.” The interviews made it clear that productions of visual data stories are  often team projects . Hence, besides the steps centering around storytelling  itself, collaboration as well as project management support are important and have to be addressed ( see Chapter 8 entitled “Organizing the Work  of Data-Driven Visual Storytelling”). For communication, standard solu - tions are used, including face-to-face meetings with whiteboards, video conferences like Google Hangouts, email, and file sharing solutions like Dropbox. Version management is important to look back at discussions and monitor progress."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"A final process concerning visual data storytelling is measuring the  impact on audiences. None of the interviewees had a systematic process for understanding impact, though they reported scanning social media and using reporting tools like Google Analytics. Also, impact can be evaluated in various ways for different audiences. Benjamin Wiederkehr remarked that for their project, the appreciative responses of organizations that were studying the topic of the story were important."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH AND DESIGN Our interviews of storytellers and the survey of the tool landscape point to opportunities and challenges for future research and development related to visual data storytelling. Our interviewees consistently reported several pain points through - out the process of creating a visual data story. These pain points result in  178   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling part from the lack of appropriate tools to support a process from end to  end. Different phases of the process are supported by different tools, and these tools are not integrated. All had managed to overcome these diffi - culties to create visual stories, but wished they had more appropriate tools to support their workflow. An open question is whether the tool variety we observed is inevitable, or if a single integrative environment that sup - ports all of the needed functionality with flexibly and extensively, might be achievable."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data stories,"Given that data stories often involve multiple related representations, other opportunities include tools to help designers create better sets of visualizations through support for design consistency across views (Qu and Hullman 2016) or better aids for conveying how data across views is related (Knudson and Carpendale 2016). Also relevant in the making a story phase is the potential for the chosen  story to be well-received by the target audience. Currently, few tools aim to support rapid evaluation of story ideas or prototype stories . However,  the existence of crowdsourcing platforms like Mechanical Turk make it relatively easy to obtain multiple perspectives on whether a story works."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"For example, a design framework might evaluate a story  180   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling idea before publication by helping the designer formulate the communica - tion objectives of the design, such as by listing the messages that an audi - ence member should come away with after using the design. The degree  to which the design supports these objectives could then be quantitatively assessed through an early-stage evaluation with a crowd. Bridging and porting stories between formats comprises a large part  of the telling a story phase, when the story begins to materialize. Given that storytellers often must rely on different tools with different formats at different phases in the process, future research might aim to bridge between tools by innovating on new formats that can be more easily shared between tools."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data stories,"CONCLUSION While visual data stories are maturing as a form of communicative visu - alization, there is a need to better understand the lifecycle of a story and support the practices and tools used for creating one. Towards this goal we have extended Lee et al.’s (2015) model of the iterative storytelling process and conducted semistructured interviews with nine professionals working in the area of visual data stories. Their rich accounts of particular expe - riences formed the basis for characterizing the major storytelling phases as exploring data, making a story, and telling a story. We then distilled the main roles involved in this process (data collector, analyst, scripter, presenter, and director) and described external factors that can impact it (audience, setting, medium, time and cost, and legal and ethical implica - tions). Based on the interviews, we attempted to outline an overview of the systems, tools, and technologies that are being used in conceiving and constructing visual data stories. While this overview is not meant to be complete, it clearly shows that the tools and technologies being used can be highly idiosyncratic and often require specialized skills in software development and data mining. A mix of manual and automatic steps in data processing and graphics generation makes it difficult to support rapid  182   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling story creation. The multiple skill sets needed, limited support for collabo - ration in creating a story, and a loosely joined toolchain can slow down the  production of visual data stories and often prevent iterative refinement. Despite these challenges, there is a growing interest among authors and readers in data-based storytelling. The directions for future research and design include helping nonprogrammers to create stories with data, easing the process of finding relevant data, supporting the evaluation of stories, and enabling teams to collaborate internally as well as with their audiences.

Data is becoming easier to collect and publish, and has quickly  become common currency for businesses, governments, and other sectors to conduct and improve their work. The importance of data visualization has quickly followed the increasing value and availability of data, and the evolution to faster and cheaper computer speed and memory. Visualizing data can take many forms, from traditional static graphs to  online data tools where users can explore and download data for their own needs."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data stories,"In between are narrative data stories that combine text and data that are in many ways more complex and sophisticated than in the past. As the demand for better data visualizations and these narrative sto - ries increases, how should groups and firms organize their workflow processes? What skill sets should they look for in their employees? What structural changes should they implement to ensure that data are making their way through the collection, analytics, and communication phases?"
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"We did  188   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling not explore these differences at length in our interviews, but suspect  those forms also drive differences in project management and organiza - tional structure. Overall, telling data-driven stories remains a function of an organiza - tion’s mission and audience. Whether an organization is rooted in design, telling stories, or data analysis, each needs each piece to effectively com - municate their work and analysis to their audience. In this chapter, we seek to explore the similarities and differences between these disparate groups and to offer insight into what makes those efforts successful."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"In addition to the design and technology leads, these teams also consist of more specialized personnel including data ana - lysts, copywriters, and illustrators, as well as more general personnel like project managers. 190   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling When it comes to technical work on a specific project, each studio  reported a close collaboration between the content, design, and technol - ogy teams. That said, the driving force in the creative process might differ. For Accurat, the design team assumes this role: “The design team I direct is at the core of our organization. The design process informs both the data analysis and the development process,” says Giorgia Lupi, the agen - cy’s design director."

The specific configuration and structure of the code base depends  on the coding principles and styles of the different team members. Process and Project Selection In comparison to the other two groups of organizations that we inter - viewed, design studios primarily work for clients on a per-project basis  and they therefore have to rely on inquiries and commissions from cli - ents. Typically, these inquiries come in two different forms: either a direct inquiry from a client who sought out a specific agency to collaborate with, or a request for proposals (RFP), where different studios may apply to win the contract."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"They ask us to embrace complexity and remind us that data-driven storytelling is about making complexity accessible, not about simplifying it. They challenge us to learn about the history, meth - odology, and theory, but then also encourage us to consciously break away from standardized visual models and preexisting beliefs in order to pro - duce something ambitious and compelling for our audience. Finally, they invite everyone to engage in the community and be part of the conversa - tion in order to learn and contribute. MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS The second group we interviewed consists of media organizations."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Many media outlets have set up specialized teams to produce visual stories based on their data-driven investigations. 194   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling We interviewed six professionals working within or closely related to  media organizations. Three described themselves as data team leaders,  and one each as an interactive team leader, editor of visuals, and data jour - nalist. These different job titles reflect the different strategies media out - lets now follow to implement visualizations with a news story and within the organizational structure of the newsroom. The groups we interviewed ranged from small, independent teams to more integrated models where one large team unites all the visually driven editors, designers, and pro - grammers within the newsroom (the list of organizations can be found in the Appendix at the end of this chapter)."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Within their “news applications desk,” developers are “responsible for an entire project, from inception through publication.  196   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling They need to build the server code to support their ultimate vision with - out slow negotiation or the friction of brain-to-brain communication,  and they need to design the presentation because they’re the person who understands the material and the visual story possibilities best.” In this case, the team manager recommended searching for people with two of the necessary skill sets and to teach him or her the third. Tools and Technologies For communicating with colleagues and project partners, most of the  teams use Slack or the open source, self-hosted alternative Mattermost. Google Hangouts, Google Drive, and GitHub were mentioned multiple times, as well as the encrypted chat system Jabber OTR and encrypted emails. These safety arrangements seem to be most important for the teams who often work together with investigative reporters and confiden - tial sources."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Even Scott Klein at ProPublica  emphasized this task: “We are working to get better  at communicating our priorities and explaining our work to the wider newsroom.” In smaller teams, this task is often taken over by the journalist who acts as a project manager and simultaneously works on the content. 198   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling When asked about their strongest recommendations, many of the  interviewed experts described two lessons. First, accept a constant change  of the ecosystem in which the team is working. By being open to learn - ing new processes and products, change can be made more smoothly and utilize skills from the entire team. This openness also enables individuals to share their work and experiences."

That group consists of seven people divided into a research side and a communication side; all seven team members, however, work together “in developing the research agenda and strategic direction of the project.” The communication and outreach department at the IDB focuses slightly  more on supporting the work of the research staff instead of publishing content outside the organization; instead, they focus on “coordinat[ing] training and techniques for making effective presentations, including sto - rytelling and script-writing.” Skill Sets Each organization specifically mentioned some staffing challenges.

Reflections and Lessons Learned We asked each organization for their strongest recommendations to  newcomers to the field of data-driven storytelling and communication. Respondents provided us with a variety of thoughts, which we have cat - egorized into three broad buckets. First, communications should not be thought of as a secondary part  of the process of communicating research: “strategic support is essen - tial” as one person put it. Respondents recognized that there often exists tension between the scientist/researcher side of the organization and the communications/marketing/design side of the organization."

Through discussion of our experiences coming from different back - grounds and past work experiences, we have identified three general areas where content producers could know more about their audience. Such knowl - edge would enable more effective communication of data-driven content.  1. Ho w literate is the audience in terms of data and visualization?"
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data story,"Data storytellers have an ethical obligation to ensure that their visualizations do not skew or mislead interpretations unnecessarily (see Chapter 10 , entitled “Ethics in Data-Driven Visual Storytelling”), and this  intersects with the literacy level of the expected audience. Increasing an audience’s understanding of different data and graph types may come from a variety of sources, some within the content-producers’ control, others not. In news graphics, the solution is what is usually called the annotation  layer. Annotations add explanations and descriptions to introduce the  graph’s context, which is important for almost any audience (Hullman et  al ., 2013)."

Thus, even for the reader who has never seen a bubble plot before, the annotation instructs them on how to read the chart, and then delivers  the content through the additional explanatory text. Background Knowledge and Expertise A content producer may face an audience with different levels of expertise  or knowledge on any given topic. Readers of a large daily newspaper like The New York Times or The Washington Post  may reflect a variety of dif - ferent levels of expertise, especially across the different topics covered by the publication."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"Data storytelling needs to take into account the baseline of information and knowledge that the intended audience is expected or assumed to have. Different levels of expertise and knowledge should encourage content  producers to think carefully about how their products will best meet the needs of a diverse audience. Niche audiences may be more comfort - able with the jargon of their group, but designers may consider whether removing jargon would serve a larger audience just as easily while mak - ing the content more broadly accessible. Universal design is an aspiration that can allow data stories to appeal to and be used by a broad array of people (Shneiderman et al ., 2016), but design is also about tradeoffs that  may make a data story less appealing to some, while simultaneously much more appealing and useful to others. In such cases, different versions of the story might be produced for different audiences, each targeting a unique range of knowledge, expertise, and other factors discussed in this chapter. An individual in the audience brings their own viewpoints, back - grounds, and experience to each and every data-driven story they con - sume. Whether driven by their cultural background, social position, education, or other demographic characteristics, readers carry with them their own unique set of knowledge and biases."

Like any other designed experience, data stories are more impactful and useful when they are crafted with the motivations, goals, and tasks of users in mind—in this case the audience for the story. The following subsections explore several typical wants and needs from media consumption that may impact design, as well how interactivity can be leveraged to increase the adaptability of data stories to different user needs and contexts. * http://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/. † https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/mooc/file/tdmn_graphics.pdf.

The idea is that people receive certain gratifications from the media they consume that help satisfy various underlying social or psychological needs. For instance, people may seek out data-driven stories for a variety of reasons such as to inform themselves on an issue of personal (e.g., health) or civic importance (e.g., elections), or to casually lean back and be entertained or pass time in a non-goal-oriented fashion. The uses and gratifications framework suggests that there are four primary underlying motivations for media consumption:  1."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data story,"A social treatment might emphasize user comments and responses to a data story, whereas an information-oriented design may focus on well-researched and vali - dated background context provided in an annotation layer. The goal as a designer is to explore the design space in order to try to match the data story to the expected media need of the audience. An individual’s needs from a piece of media like a data story can also  vary with the intended interface. For instance, if a story is likely to be consumed on a mobile device, the user could be in a loud or distract - ing environment that might undermine the use of audio in the narrative (written annotations as backup is a nice design strategy). The specific loca - tion of a user on a GPS-enabled device can be interesting context that can be used to inform the way a story is presented (Kim et al ., 2016). In  contexts that are more casual than work-oriented, users may have a higher  Communicating Data to an Audience    ◾   223 degree of interruptibility, which could mean that a data story is consumed  in short bursts of attention. Presenting information in “chunked” patterns might be more effective than as a single, long-form narrative in such cases. Finally, it is worth considering that boredom may be a driving factor for interaction in contexts where the user is consuming a data story while waiting (e.g., for a bus or train), or splitting attention between devices and screens (e.g., as many people do when watching television). Tailoring to the Audience without Knowing It Even if we do not know anything about the audience, we can make it  appear as if we did. The audience knows itself: they can pick their city in a story about home prices, their age and gender in a story on health, and their education and income levels in a story about taxes or inequality. This self-identification in a visualization may be why maps are such  a popular tool in data visualization."

This can help engagement by allowing them to place themselves in a context (and at the same time also collect data to be shown to everybody), and it has also recently been found to help people remem - ber what they have seen. In 2011, The New York Times published “The Death of a Terrorist: A  Turning Point?” (Huang and Pilhofer 2011) where readers were invited to position their opinions on the death of Osama bin Laden in a two-dimensional  matrix: whether their response was positive or negative over - all, and whether they thought that this event was going to be significant in the war on terror or not. The resulting heatmap of responses showed the landscape of people’s responses."

Interactive pieces like this are still relatively rare, but they are slowly  gaining momentum. A recent study tested the effect of asking readers to make estimates before showing the actual data on memory (Kim et al .,  2017) (Figure 9.6).

News media, like other organizations, have struggled with different device types, browser idio - syncrasies, screen sizes, as well as different technologies and program - ming languages (such as the switch from Flash to HTML5). Designing for devices means not only taking their idiosyncrasies into  account, but taking advantage of them. Trying to design across many devices typically ends up with a sort of lowest common denominator that works but is not as effective as it could be on any specific device."

Well-regarded  ethics codes like those from National Public Radio (NPR)* and the  Associated Press (AP)† do at least mention data and graphics, and a revised  2017 version of the AP Stylebook includes a whole chapter on best practices  in data journalism, but, for example, a widely used ethics guide from the Society for Professional Journalists (SPJ) does not mention data at all and includes only an oblique reference not to “distort…visual information.” ‡  Despite the use of data-driven graphics in the news context for at least a couple hundred years, a robust articulation of ethical mandates for responsible usage has largely failed to emerge and become widely adopted. This chapter is a step in the direction of articulating a framework for  thinking about ethical decisions and pitfalls that relate directly to creat - ing data-driven visual stories. In particular, I approach this within the pragmatist-realist discourse on data visualization (Dick 2016), meaning that I focus on the utilitarian usage of data visualization in the journalistic news media in comparison to other usages for persuasion or for artistic storytelling, which have different ethical commitments."

As will be discussed in the next sections, opportunities for (mis-)guiding end-users’ interpretation of data can arise during every phase of production from acquisition and how the data is quantified, to how it is normalized, aggregated, filtered, visually encoded, annotated, and made interactive. Principle #2 is relevant to the ways in which insights from data are  found and interpreted as stories. Given that many interpretations may arise from a data set, it becomes important for the storyteller to be able to trace and disclose their rationale and process for arriving at a preferred interpretation."

The basic issue is that, for many types of data, plotting them on a choropleth map will sim - ply show hot spots in areas of high population. The map ends up showing high population density around urban areas rather than the variable of interest. The correction here is to divide by the population in the area (e.g., state) that is being mapped, thus transforming the variable mapped to a population-normalized value."

Algorithmic Derivation In addition to normalization and aggregation, more sophisticated algo - rithms are sometimes employed to derive new pieces of data. For instance,  an analyst might use a classifier to predict a social media user’s age or sex based on their connections or posts, or a sentiment analysis routine to determine whether an online review is positive or negative in tone, or a geocoder to translate a written address into a latitude/longitude pair."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Filtering Filtering what is shown is an essential operation that enables success- ful data-driven storytelling by focusing attention on relevant cases and removing distraction. Filtering data, or the visual process of cropping, requires ethical consideration with respect to the relevance (or irrelevance) of variables, individual cases, or ranges of variables being visualized. In some cases, outliers may be removed from the display (or removed before an aggregation step). Filtering also relates to the idea of cherry-picking—selecting only the data to display that supports an opinion the author has or which otherwise benefits the author in some way."

For instance, consider a map  published in 2012 by The Journal News  in Westchester, NY showing dots at  each address where there was a gun permit holder. After publication there was considerable pushback and concern that the map made it too easy to see personal information that could create risks for individuals. Because members of a community can easily infer the identity of each dot based on the address shown, complete anonymization would require a reduction in visual fidelity such as by visualizing the data aggregated by zip code.* CONVEYING AND CONNECTING INSIGHTS Visual Mapping and Representation Edward Tufte’s advice on graphic integrity still rings true: “A graphic does  not distort if the visual representation of the data is consistent with the numerical representation” (Tufte 2001)."

Temporal, spa - tial, or general to specific comparisons are often conveyed through sub - sequent views in interactive slideshow narratives or videographics; causal interpretations of such comparisons can result (Hullman et al. 2013b). Definitions of narrative revolve around the notion of a sequence of events that are causally related (Segel and Heer 2010). The human mind is prone to filling in causal explanations when we experience a story (Gottschall 2013), so it is particularly important to be aware of how readers may form interpretations of variable associations and if possible, to preempt com - mon misinterpretations."

Ethically, the goal in providing context and annotation is to provide  context that is relevant, does not distract, and guides the reader towards the most plausible, logical, and faithful interpretation of the data. If a particular editorial interpretation of the data is conveyed via the context and annotations, then ideally this would also be indicated to the end-user. Care should be taken so that labels, legends, definitions, and other context are presented in a straightforward way that minimizes the potential for misinterpretation and which is complete enough for the viewer to fully comprehend the interpretation presented."

By considering tradeoffs in choices related to these various factors,  the intent of this chapter is to help the data storyteller become more cog - nizant of their role and responsibility in guiding the interpretation of the audience. Whether in the data acquisition or transformation stages, when mapping data to charts, or connecting those charts into a sequence, eth - ics in this domain is predominantly about making sound editorial deci - sions that ensure the reception of accurate interpretations of the data. Of course, whether a story is interpreted accurately is also contingent on the data and visual literacy of the audience to begin with, and so ethical sto - rytelling also attempts to understand the audience (see Chapter 9 entitled “Communicating Data to an Audience”) and provide scaffolding of neces - sary literacies to ensure accurate interpretation. When errors do arise and there is a widespread unintended reception or interpretation that is untrue or misleading, the ethical storyteller will issue a correction, and update the story so that any misinterpretation can be avoided in the future."

The first question pertains to how we should evaluate data-driven stories, while the second question pertains to how we should evaluate the tools and techniques developed to produce these stories. Before we address these questions, however, it is also worth asking  whether evaluation is even necessary or informative; what can we hope to learn from evaluating stories, tools, and techniques? To many, evalu - ation evokes laborious and methodical experiments and academic stud - ies; in this chapter, we reveal how evaluation can assume many forms beyond academic experimentation, and that evaluation is not solely within the purview of researchers."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Another intent of this chapter is to provide links to relevant literature and to promote further cross-pollination between academic research and the applied practice of data-driven storytelling. Evaluation has been discussed in the human-computer interaction literature for decades [1], and it has more recently become a popular topic in the information visualization community [2,3]. Meanwhile, a number of journalists and publishers have questioned the efficacy of data-driven storytelling and standards by which their stories should be measured, and throughout this chapter we refer to a number of recent essays and blog posts by influential members of the journalism community that discuss this emerging topic. Outline In the “Goals and Perspectives” section, we discuss the goals of vari - ous stakeholders related to data-driven storytelling.

The “Evaluation Methods” section follows, in which we enumerate a variety of methods for evaluating data-driven stories and tools for generating these stories. In the “Evaluation Metrics” sec - tion, we list objective metrics that can be recorded during the execution of the aforementioned methods that serve as proxies to the more-abstract evaluation criteria. Throughout the “Goals and Perspectives,” “Evaluation Criteria,” and “Evaluation Methods” sections, we provide links to related downstream concepts, such as from goals to criteria or from methods to specific metrics."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"GOALS AND PERSPECTIVES We begin our discussion of evaluation by considering the perspectives of the various stakeholders involved in the data-driven storytelling process. By understanding and prioritizing the goals of these stakeholders, one can determine appropriate evaluation criteria, methods, and metrics. We con - sider the goals of the author or storyteller, the publisher, the storytelling tool builder, as well as the audience. Author/Storyteller Goals Working at the intersection of several professions, authors of data-driven  stories have to address different challenges and demands."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data storytelling,"The concept of data storytelling as a way of information delivery has been popularized by   256   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling the leading media organizations such as The New York Ti mes [8] and The  Guardian  [9]. Taking advantage of data-driven journalism supported by  visualization, these organizations maintain their lead by making infor - mation more appealing for their audience. Data-driven stories can also be  used for educational purposes. By creating stories, teachers can enhance lessons including facts supported by data as way of making abstract or conceptual content more understandable."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data story,"This powerful com - bination can result in a data story that can influence and drive change. By starting a conversation on important issues surrounding a topic, the author can reach a wider audience and result in changing the collective opinion about the topic. To Persuade to Action or Change Behavior Related to the use of data-driven stories as a way of communication, ultimately the communicator would like the audience to learn about  the content presented through the story and be able to refer to it while making important decisions related to the subject presented in the story. For instance, a data-driven story presenting the data on the issue of global warming [11] aims at educating the audience about the issue by highlight - ing the evidence supporting the problem and hopefully resulting in the change in behavior and triggering action."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"For example, the 2016 Pulitzer Prizes awarded two projects that featured impressive interactive graph - ics, prompting Alberto Cairo, Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at the   258   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling University of Miami, to call for an infographics and data visualization  category for the Pulitzer Prizes [17]. To Appear as Being Aligned with Journalistic Values By using rich interactive data-visualization tools and techniques within their reporting, journalists can demonstrate their support for distinct  ideologies not referring to paradigms or worldviews, but to basic journalis - tic values. Above all, these values are closely related to those of investigative reporters, such as independence, a critical attitude, and a focus on injustices. Alexander Howard also describes this close link between data and watchdog journalism: “It’s integral to a global strategy to support investigative jour - nalism that holds the most powerful institutions and entities in the world accountable, from the wealthiest people on Earth, to those involved in orga - nized crime, multinational corporations, legislators, and presidents” [4]."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"In this section, we describe the publisher perspective and what they  might expect  from data-driven storytelling. As we do not distinguish  between CEO or editor-in-chief, we use the term publisher. Both in fiction and in reality, publishers face economic pressure:  whether it be due to falling circulation numbers or the increasing num - ber of digital competitors, distribution channels, and changing format requirements. But it is not only cost-cutting that makes it necessary for publishers to define goals and derive criteria and metrics from them."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"He reported: “The top ten most clicked stories   260   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling in 2014 on morgenpost.de come from the Interactive team. Their stories go  viral, reach new audiences, and generate reach. Now even advertisers ask for ads within those formats” [22]. In addition to page views, interactive graphics may also increase the  amount of time readers spend viewing articles."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"In the context of data-driven storytelling, it means the abil - ity of a publisher to lead in a certain segment of journalism relative to its competitors. This ability is indicated by journalism awards, as the juries for these awards consist of experts within the profession. As data journalism and data-driven storytelling are new forms, it is  very attractive for every journalism award board to offer them as a cat - egory. Hence, a lot of awards exist for this field, making it easier for a publisher and an outstanding project to win a lot of them. Julius Troger and his team at the daily newspaper Berliner Morgenpost  proved that with “M29–The Bus Route of Contrasts,” published in 2015 [24]. He explained the project in an interview: “The bus route cuts straight through Berlin."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"On the international level, in 2015, the “M29” story was among the final - ists of the Online Journalism Awards (OJAs) [25], honoring excellence in   262   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling digital journalism around the world. The well-known Kantar Information  is Beautiful Award [14] selected Julius Troger and his colleagues as Best Team in 2015. To Increase Engagement “There are journalists doing great work to actively engage the audi - ence in the storytelling process,” says Amanda Zamora [26] who at  the time was Senior Engagement Editor at ProPublica. Impact as a conse - quence of audience engagement is very important  not only for these non - profit newsrooms, but also for the traditional publishers, as their increasing hiring of so-called audience-engagement editors shows."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Mary Hamilton, the executive editor for audience at The Guardian , said: “It’s become  pretty clear that without building a living community of people who care about the issue around the journalism, the journalism would be much less successful.” Data-Driven Storytelling Tool/Technique Developer Goals Those who develop tools and techniques for data-driven storytell - ing may have several motivations. In some cases, the tool or tech - nique developer is or has been an author of data-driven stories herself  or himself and builds tools or techniques in order to improve or hasten the storytelling workflow. For instance, consider TimeLineCurator [31], a tool for authoring visual timeline stories; prior to developing this tool,   Evaluating Data-Driven Stories and Storytelling Tools    ◾   263 the primary author had previously been generating timeline stories manu - ally using illustration software, which was often a time-consuming and  tedious process. Though a tool or technique developer may be motivated by their own  storytelling needs, developers often make their tools or techniques avail - able, either publicly or within an organization, with the hope that their tool or technique can be adopted into the storytelling workflows or more generally be used by other people who are also telling data-driven stories."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"For example, Choe et al. [33] recently documented this form of data-driven storytelling at a Quantified Self conference in which the audience was united in an interest in self-tracking and were eager to hear the data-driven stories of other Quantified Selfers.  264   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling Like at a conference, another context in which the audience and story - teller are colocated is in the classroom. Ideally, students are also motivated  to learn about a topic and develop their critical thinking skills. Yet another context in which the audience and storyteller are colocated  is in an organizational context, such as in a corporate management meet - ing or a public policy planning meeting. In these contexts, the audience may be motivated by a common need to make a policy decision."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"However, it is important to recognize that there is also an audience for data-driven storytelling that cares greatly about the medium itself. Because of this audience, there are now conferences and awards dedicated to this genre of storytelling (e.g., the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards [14]) as well as an interest in the technical solutions and design choices that lead to these data-driven stories (e.g., the Knight-Mozilla OpenNews Source project [19]). This audience will likely be interested in learning about the storyteller’s process and the techniques that he or she used while research - ing and constructing his or her story. Evaluating Data-Driven Stories and Storytelling Tools    ◾   265 EVALUATION CRITERIA Storytellers, publishers, tool builders, and audience members can assess  whether their goals have been met according to a variety of criteria."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Furthermore,  266   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling interactive data visualization is increasingly integrated into stories pub - lished online. It would be important to understand the readability of these  data stories, which require people to understand not only visual represen - tations but also how to interact with these representations. Memorability      Representing one of the most interesting criteria for evalu - ating the impact of data-driven stories is the question of  whether or not the audience can recall (1) the content (e.g., different com - ponents [39], story units, and visualizations [37]), (2) the message(s) con - veyed, and (3) the reasoning behind the story. Data-driven stories strive to deliver a message and therefore the ability to memorize and recall the message(s) is important. On the other hand, every element in a data-driven story serves that exact purpose (i.e., conveying the message); hence, by making these components memorable, individually, we can make sure that the main goal is achieved even more powerfully."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"For example, in the  268   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling documentary film An Inconvenient Truth [45] directed by Davis  Guggenheim, the former United States Vice President Al Gore had consid - erable credibility while educating citizens about global warming. Criteria for Evaluating Data-Driven Storytelling Tools There are several criteria to consider when evaluating a data-driven sto - rytelling tool: expressiveness, efficiency, usability, learnability, collabora - tion, and integration. Most tools do not excel with respect to all of these  criteria; good tool designers attempt to balance these criteria, as there are typically trade-offs made when prioritizing one criteria over the others. Expressiveness In the context of tools for storytelling, expressiveness relates to the range of possible stories that a storyteller could create using the  tool, or the number of design choices that a storyteller could make. These design choices include the selection of visual representations and interac - tions, ranging from a constrained set of chart types and interactions such as mouse-over tooltips to totally custom visual encoding and novel inter - actions; for example, an author can create a story in Tableau [46] using a palette of prespecified chart types, while a storyteller can combine graphi - cal primitive shapes using Lyra [47] to generate custom presentation -   or iented charts."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Extensibility Storytelling tools may not be highly expressive or well-integrated out of the box, but they may be extensible or modular in such a way that   270   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling allows authors to customize or repurpose the existing features of the tool,  or add new features that increases expressiveness or workflow integration. Collaboration Finally, collaboration in this context relates to whether multiple sto - rytellers can use a tool to generate a story together. Additional con - siderations with respect to collaboration include whether storytellers can collaborate using multiple devices or gathered around a single device, and whether collaboration can take place synchronously or asynchronously. Collaboration support for data-driven storytelling tools can include fea - tures such as version control and the ability to comment on and discuss the story being produced. EVALUATION METHODS In this section, we describe the methods by which the criteria defined above can be evaluated. We identify methods for evaluating data-driven stories and for evaluating storytelling tools and techniques. Any evaluation method is associated with one or more metrics, types of  data that are collected during the evaluation (we discuss metrics in detail in the following section)."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Questionnaires and Interviews          Self-reporting methods such as postviewing question - naires (e.g., the Likert scale questionnaire), semi- and  fully constructed interviews, as well as Product Reaction Cards [53] can be  272   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling designed to evaluate data-driven stories. For instance, we could build a  standard questionnaire to measure engagement, which will make it possi - ble to compare different data-driven stories. Similarly , we can use question - naires and audience comments to target whether or not a data-driven story has increased audience knowledge about a topic. Examples of such ques-tions, derived from Product Reaction Cards [53], are listed below: What did you learn that you did not already know?"
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,narrative visualization,"The application of a flow model to evaluate enjoy - ment in visualization including narrative visualization has recently been proposed [56]. Collecting audience ratings can also be a way of getting quick insights  from the audience. For example, Amini et al. [57] compared the quality of data-driven videos created using DataClips with videos created using other tools by having an independent group of people view and rank the videos. Audience ratings can go beyond collecting numbers by breaking down the narrative into story units and asking the audience to not only rate each unit separately, but also to provide reasons as to why the par - ticular rating was assigned."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Methods for Evaluating Data-Driven Storytelling Tools To evaluate the expressiveness of a storytelling tool, one method is to gen - erate a large number and a variety of stories based on a similarly wide vari - ety of source data. A similar method involves recreating or approximating  a wide variety of existing published stories. Usability Studies To evaluate the usability and learnability of a storytelling tool, a simple usability study may be appropriate [60] in which participants  naive to the tool are recruited and instructed to accomplish a specific goal or a series of specific tasks such as recreating or approximating an existing story or a series of presentation-oriented charts. As they attempt to com - plete these tasks, participants should be encouraged to think aloud while interacting with the interface of the tool."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Following the recreation of these charts, the participants were free to   274   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling generate their own designs. Throughout both stages, participants followed  a think-aloud protocol. First-Use Studies A variant of the usability study is the first-use study; Satyanarayan and Heer conducted such a first-use study as a means to evaluate  whether Ellipsis [62], a narrative visualization storytelling tool, fit the needs and workflows of journalists. After demonstrating the features of Ellipsis to eight journalists, Satyanarayan and Heer asked the journalists to author a short story with a particular set of charts based on a familiar story published by The New York Times . The same authors conducted a  similar first-use study with Lyra [47], an interactive presentation-  or iented  visualization design environment. In that study, they recruited 15 people including a mix of journalists, designers, analysts, and students."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"A/B Testing    Another method for evaluating a data-driven storytelling tool  is a comparative A/B study, either comparing different versions  of a tool containing alternative designs, or comparing a prototype tool to an existing tool. In the latter case, evaluators should ensure a fair com - parison: the two tools should accomplish the same goal and have compa - rable functionality, and comparable or identical source data should be supplied to participants for each version. The purpose of comparing dif - ferent tools would be to compare them in terms of efficiency, usability, and learnability. An example of such a comparative evaluation was a compari - son of TimeLineCurator’s timeline story producing process [31] to the timeline story producing process of TimelineJS [50] in which participants authored the same story with both tools."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Case Studies    Finally, data-driven storytelling tools can and should be eval - uated in the wild: with real storytellers telling stories with  data that is personally or professionally relevant to them. One approach is to recruit journalists or data analysts who need to communicate their findings as part of their work. For example, the designers of iVisDe - signer [61] recruited a data analyst who wanted to communicate findings from his analysis of social media data; they were able to ingest his data and they reported on a case study of this analyst using iVisDesigner to create presentation-oriented charts. Another approach is to deploy and promote a tool online, monitor its usage information, and solicit feed - back from the community of early adopters, such as in the case of TimeLineCurator [31]."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"For example, the specific moment in time when a piece is published can be crucial concerning its audience and performance, as well as its positioning on the website or other distribution channels used.   276   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling In addition to the metric of time, supportive measures on social media  platforms can also make a difference. This is crucial to keep in mind if you analyze metrics originating from the measurement, the collection, and reporting of Internet data (Web analytics). First and foremost, they are used to get a better understanding of users consuming content online on a single web page. Nevertheless, they can provide valuable hints on how the audience reacts to your published data-driven stories."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"For data jour - nalism and data-driven storytelling, a lot of them exist on a  national and international level. Hence, the number of awards a story gets can serve as a quantitative metric, too. For details, see the section entitled “To Increase Leadership .” Physiological Responses       Physiological responses and signals collected during the  consumption of a data-driven story can be used to  understand the processing of information being presented. For example, collecting statistics about ocular movements of the audience while read - ing or viewing a story has been used to compare stories generated using different strategies (i.e., infographics vs. newspaper articles) [63]."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"By comparing these groups, the evaluation of one single piece can be further intensified, leading to sophisticated findings that can also be used in comparisons between sev - eral stories. 278   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling Traffic Sources    Readers can reach stories from various directions, resulting in  different usage settings and levels of involvement. Thus, clus - tering the traffic based on its sources can help newsrooms to evaluate dif - ferent distribution channels they use and the visibility of their output for search algorithms. Chartbeat, one of the most common metrics vendors, distinguishes between five categories of traffic sources: direct, social, external, internal, and search [64]. Direct traffic includes readers who typed in a specific uniform resource  locator (URL) or used a bookmark, hence, to reach the website consciously."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"One foci of interest when analyzing comments on data-driven stories is whether the audience discusses the context around the story or specific data featured in the story [66]. 280   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling A related foci of interest when analyzing audience comments in  response to a data-driven story is whether the audience is commenting on  and discussing the particular elements or trends in the data highlighted by the author or if the audience is discussing other elements or trends not discussed by the author, as well as whether the audience is acknowledging, supporting, or refuting the data-driven conclusions of the author [67]. Another metric of interest is a change in reader opinion. One way to  collect this data is to gather the opinions of an audience about a subject or topic prior to exposing them to a story. After consuming the story, the audience can be polled again to assess whether any change of opinion has taken place and whether this change of opinion can be attributed to spe - cific data points or trends featured in the story."
B13,Data-Driven Storytelling,1,0,data-driven storytelling,"Evaluation is a wide-reaching concept, and the term evokes different meanings in different domains:  282   ◾   Data-Driven Storytelling evaluation of a data-driven story in a newsroom will be very different from  the evaluation of a novel storytelling technique in an academic research setting. For this reason, we classified the diverse set of goals of storytell - ers, publishers, readers, tool builders, and researchers. Given these goals, we then enumerated possible criteria for assessing whether these goals are met, as well as evaluation methods and metrics that approximate these criteria. It is our intent that this chapter serves as a rough guide for those considering whether and how they should evaluate the stories they pro - duce or the storytelling tools or techniques that they develop."
